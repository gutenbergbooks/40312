<h2>THE INTOXICATED GHOST</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was not her beauty which made Irene
Gaspic unusual, although she was bewitchingly
pretty; nor yet her wit, her cleverness,
or her wealth, albeit she was well endowed
with all these good gifts: other girls were
pretty, and wise, and witty, and rich. It was
something far more piquant and rare which
marked Irene as different from her mates,
the fact being that from her great-aunt on
the mother&rsquo;s side, an old lady who for nearly
ninety years displayed to her fellow-mortals
one of the most singular characters possible,
Irene had inherited the power of seeing
ghosts.</p>

<p>It is so generally regarded as a weakness
even to believe in disembodied spirits that in
justice to Irene it is but fair to remark that
she believed in them only because she could
not help seeing them, and that the power with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
which she was endowed had come to her by
inheritance quite without any wish on her
part. Any fair-minded person must perceive
the difference between seeing ghosts because
one is so foolish as to believe in them, and
believing in their existence because one cannot
help seeing them. It might be added,
moreover, that the firmness which Miss
Gaspic had displayed when visited by some
of the most unpleasant wraiths in the whole
category should be allowed to tell in her favor.
When she was approached during a visit to
Castle Doddyfoethghw&mdash;where, as every
traveler in Wales is aware, is to be found the
most ghostly phantom in the three kingdoms&mdash;by
a gory figure literally streaming with
blood, and carrying its mangled head in its
hands, she merely remarked coldly: &ldquo;Go
away at once, please. You do not alarm me
in the least; but to come into the presence
of a lady in such a state of unpleasant dismemberment
is in shockingly bad taste.&rdquo;
Whereat the poor wraith fell all along the
ground in astonishment and alarm, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a stain of blood upon the stone floor, which
may be seen to this day by any one who
doubts the tale enough to go to Castle
Doddyfoethghw to see.</p>

<p>Although Irene seldom referred to her inheritance,
and professed, when she did speak
of it, to feel a lively indignation that her aunt
Eunice Mariamne should have thrust upon
her such a bequest, she was too thoroughly
human and feminine to lack wholly a secret
pride that she should be distinguished by a
gift so unusual. She had too good taste openly
to talk of it, yet she had not the firmness
entirely to conceal it; and her friends were
pretty generally aware of the legacy and of
many circumstances resulting from its possession.
Some few of her intimates, indeed,
had ventured to employ her good offices in
communicating with family wraiths; and
although Irene was averse to anything which
savored so strongly of mediumship and other
vulgar trades, she could not but be pleased
at the excellent results which had followed
her mediations in several instances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>When, therefore, she one day received a
note from her old school friend Fanny McHugh,
inviting her to come down to visit her
at Oldtower, with the mysterious remark,
&ldquo;I not only long to see you, dear, but there
is something most important that you can
do for me, and nobody but you,&rdquo; Irene at
once remembered that the McHughs had a
family ghost, and was convinced that she
was invited, so to say, in her professional
capacity.</p>

<p>She was, however, by no means averse to
going, and that for several reasons. The
McHugh estate was a beautiful old place in
one of the loveliest of New England villages,
where the family had been in the ascendancy
since pre-Revolutionary days; Irene was sufficiently
fond of Fanny; and she was well
aware, in virtue of that intuition which enables
women to know so many things, that
her friend&rsquo;s brother, Arthur McHugh, would
be at home at the time named for the visit.
Irene and Lieutenant Arthur McHugh had
been so much to each other at one time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
they had been to the very verge of a formal
engagement, when at the last moment he
drew back. There was no doubt of his affection,
but he was restrained from asking Irene
to share his fortunes by the unpleasant
though timely remembrance that he had
none. The family wealth, once princely for
the country and time, had dwindled until
little remained save the ancestral mansion
and the beautiful but unremunerative lawns
surrounding it.</p>

<p>Of course this conduct upon the part of
Lieutenant McHugh was precisely that which
most surely fixed him in the heart of Irene.
The lover who continues to love, but unselfishly
renounces, is hardly likely to be forgotten;
and it is to be presumed that it was
with more thought of the young and handsome
lieutenant in flesh and blood than of
the Continental major in ghostly attenuation
who lurked in the haunted chamber that
Miss Gaspic accepted the invitation to Oldtower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Oldtower stands in a wild and beautiful village,
left on one side by modern travel, which
has turned away from the turnpike of the fathers
to follow the more direct route of the
rail. The estate extends for some distance
along the bank of the river, which so twists
in its windings as almost to make the village
an island, and on a knoll overlooking the
stream moulders the crumbling pile of stone
which once was a watch-tower, and from
which the place takes its name.</p>

<p>The house is one of the finest of old colonial
mansions, and is beautifully placed upon
a terrace half a dozen feet above the level of
the ample lawn which surrounds it. Back of
the house a trim garden with box hedges as
high as the gardener&rsquo;s knee extends down
to the river, while in front a lofty hedge shuts
off the grounds from the village street. Miss
Fanny, upon whom had largely devolved the
care of the estate since the death of her
widowed mother, had had the good sense to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
confine her efforts to keeping things in good
order in the simplest possible way; and the
result was that such defects of management
as were rendered inevitable by the smallness
in income presented themselves to the eye
rather as evidences of mellowness than of
decay, and the general effect remained most
charming.</p>

<p>Irene had always been fond of the McHugh
place, and everything was in the perfection of
its June fairness when she arrived. Her meeting
with Fanny was properly effusive, while
Arthur gratified her feminine sense by greeting
her with outward calmness while he allowed
his old passion to appear in his eyes. There
were, of course, innumerable questions to be
asked, as is usual upon such occasions, and
some of them were even of sufficient importance
to require answers; so that the afternoon
passed rapidly away, and Irene had no
opportunity to refer to the favor to which her
friend&rsquo;s letter had made allusion. Her suspicion
that she had been summoned in her
capacity of ghost-seer was confirmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fact that she had been put in the haunted
room, a fine square chamber in the southeast
wing, wainscoted to the ceiling, and one of the
handsomest apartments in the house. This
room had been especially decorated and fitted
up for one Major Arthur McHugh, a great-great-uncle
of the present McHughs, who had
served with honor under Lafayette in the Revolution.
The major had left behind him the
reputation of great personal bravery, a portrait
which showed him as extremely handsome,
and the fame of having been a great
lady-killer and something of a rake withal;
while he had taken out of the world with him,
or at least had not left behind, the secret of
what he had done with the famous McHugh
diamonds. Major McHugh was his father&rsquo;s
eldest son, and in the family the law of primogeniture
was in his day pretty strictly
observed, so that to him descended the estate.
A disappointment in love resulted in his
refusing to marry, although urged thereto by
his family and much reasoned with by disinterested
mothers with marriageable daughters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
He bequeathed the estate to the eldest
son of his younger brother, who had been
named for him, and this Arthur McHugh
was the grandfather of the present lieutenant.</p>

<p>With the estate went the famous McHugh
diamonds, at that time the finest in America.
The &ldquo;McHugh star,&rdquo; a huge stone of rose
cut, had once been the eye of an idol in the
temple of Majarah, whence it had been stolen
by the sacrilegious Rajah of Zinyt, from
whose possession it passed into the hands of
a Colonel McHugh at the siege of Zinyt in
1707. There was an effort made, about the
middle of the eighteenth century, to add
this beautiful gem to the crown jewels of
France, but the McHugh then at the head of
the family, the father of Major McHugh,
declared that he would sooner part with wife
and children than with the &ldquo;McHugh star,&rdquo;
an unchristian sentiment, which speaks better
for his appreciation of jewels than for his
family affection.</p>

<p>When Major McHugh departed from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
life, in 1787, the McHugh diamonds were
naturally sought for by his heir, but were
nowhere to be found. None of the family
knew where they were usually kept&mdash;a circumstance
which was really less singular
than it might at first appear, since the major
was never communicative, and in those days
concealment was more relied upon for the
safety of small valuables than the strength
which the modern safe, with its misleading
name, is supposed to supply. The last that
was known of the gems was their being worn
at a ball in 1785 by the sister-in-law of the
owner, to whom they had been loaned for
the occasion. Here they had attracted the
greatest attention and admiration, but on
their return to Major McHugh they seemed
to vanish forever. Search had of course been
made, and one generation after another,
hearing the traditions, and believing in its
own cleverness, had renewed the endeavor,
but thus far the mystery had remained
unsolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was when the girls were brushing out
their hair together in that hour before retiring
which is traditionally sacred to feminine confidences,
that Irene asked rather abruptly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Fanny, what is it that you want of
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want?&rdquo; replied her friend, who could not
possibly help being femininely evasive. &ldquo;I
want to see you, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the guest returned, smiling; &ldquo;and
that is the reason you gave me this room,
which I never had before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hostess blushed. &ldquo;It is the handsomest
room in the house,&rdquo; she said defensively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And one shares it,&rdquo; Irene added, &ldquo;with
the ghost of the gallant major.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know,&rdquo; protested Fanny, &ldquo;that
you do not mind ghosts in the least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so very much now that I am used to
them. They are poor creatures; and it seems
to me that they get feebler the more people
refuse to believe in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; cried Fanny, in
the greatest anxiety, &ldquo;that the major&rsquo;s ghost
has faded away, do you? Nobody has slept
here for years, so that nobody has seen it for
ever so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you want me to assure it that you
think it eminently respectable to have a
wraith in the family, so you hope it will persevere
in haunting Oldtower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is n&rsquo;t that at all,&rdquo; Fanny said,
lowering her voice. &ldquo;I suppose Arthur would
be furious if he knew it, or that I even mentioned
it, but I am sure it is more for his
sake than for my own. Don&rsquo;t you think that
it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are simply too provoking for anything,&rdquo;
Irene responded. &ldquo;I am sure I never
saw a ghost that talked so unintelligibly as
you do. What in the world do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, only the other day Arthur said in
joke that if somebody could only make the
major&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; she looked around to indicate
the word which she evidently did not care to
pronounce in that chamber, and Irene nodded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to signify that she understood&mdash;&ldquo;if only
somebody could make it tell where the McHugh
diamonds are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; interrupted Irene.
&ldquo;Well, my dear, I am willing to speak to the
major, if he will give me an opportunity;
but it is not likely that I can do much. He
will not care for what I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But appeal to his family pride,&rdquo; Fanny
said, with an earnestness that betrayed the
importance of this matter to her. &ldquo;Tell
him how we are going to ruin for want of
just the help those diamonds would give
us. He ought to have some family pride
left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Gaspic naturally did not wish to
draw her friend into a conversation upon the
financial straits of the family, and she therefore
managed to turn the conversation, only
repeating her promise that if the wraith of the
major put in an appearance, she would do
whatever lay in her power to get from him
the secret which he had kept for a century.
It was not long before Fanny withdrew, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
taking a book, Irene sat down to read, and
await her visitor.</p>

<p>It was just at midnight that the major&rsquo;s
spirit made its appearance. It was a ghost
of a conventional period, and it carefully
observed all the old-time conditions. Irene,
who had been waiting for it, raised her eyes
from the book which she had been reading,
and examined it carefully. The ghost had
the likeness of a handsome man of rather
more than middle age and of majestic presence.
The figure was dressed in Continental
uniform, and in its hand carried a glass
apparently full of red wine. As Irene raised
her eyes, the ghost bowed gravely and courteously,
and then drained the cup to its
depth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; Miss Gaspic said politely.
&ldquo;Will you be seated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The apparition was evidently startled by
this cool address, and, instead of replying,
again bowed and again drained its glass,
which had in some mysterious manner become
refilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Irene said, in answer to his
repeated salute; &ldquo;please sit down. I was
expecting you, and I have something to
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ghost of the dead-and-gone major
stared more than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; he responded, in a
thinly interrogative tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray be seated,&rdquo; Irene invited him for
the third time.</p>

<p>The ghost wavered into an old-fashioned
high-backed chair, which remained distinctly
visible through his form, and for a moment or
two the pair eyed each other in silence. The
situation seemed somehow to be a strained
one even to the ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Irene said, breaking
the silence, &ldquo;that it would be hard for you to
refuse the request of a lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, impossible,&rdquo; the ghost quavered,
with old-time gallantry; &ldquo;especially of a
lovely creature like some we could mention.
Anything,&rdquo; he added in a slightly altered
tone, as if his experiences in ghostland had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
taught him the need of caution&mdash;&ldquo;anything
in reason, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irene smiled her most persuasive smile.
&ldquo;Do I look like one who would ask unreasonable
things?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure that nothing which you should
ask could be unreasonable,&rdquo; the ghost replied,
with so much gallantry that Irene had
for a moment a confused sense of having
lost her identity, since to have a ghost complimenting
her naturally gave her much the
feeling of being a ghost herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And certainly the McHugh diamonds can
do you no good now,&rdquo; Miss Gaspic continued,
introducing her subject with truly
feminine indirectness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The McHugh diamonds?&rdquo; echoed the
ghost stammeringly, as if the shock of the
surprise, under which he grew perceptibly
thinner, was almost more than his incorporeal
frame could endure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Irene. &ldquo;Of course I
have no claim on them, but the family is in
severe need, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They wish to sell my diamonds!&rdquo; exclaimed
the wraith, starting up in wrath.
&ldquo;The degenerate, unworthy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Words seemed to fail him, and in an agitated
manner he swallowed two or three
glasses of wine in quick succession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; Irene asked irrelevantly, &ldquo;do
you seem to be always drinking wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he answered sadly, &ldquo;I dropped
dead while I was drinking the health of Lady
Betty Rafferty, and since then I have to do it
whenever I am in the presence of mortals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can you not stop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only when your ladyship is pleased to
command me,&rdquo; he replied, with all his old-fashioned
elaborateness of courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as to the diamonds,&rdquo; Irene said,
coming back to that subject with an abruptness
which seemed to be most annoying to
the ghost, &ldquo;of what possible use can they be
to you in your present condition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What use?&rdquo; echoed the shade of the
major, with much fierceness. &ldquo;They are my
occupation. I am their guardian spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she urged, bringing to bear those
powers of logic upon which she always had
prided herself, &ldquo;you drink the ghost of wine,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, madam,&rdquo; the spirit answered,
evidently confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why can you not be content with
guarding the ghost of the McHugh diamonds,
while you let the real, live Arthur McHugh
have the real stones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that,&rdquo; the apparition returned, with
true masculine perversity, &ldquo;is different&mdash;quite
different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it different?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I am the guardian of a genuine
treasure. I am the most considerable personage
in our whole circle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your circle?&rdquo; interrupted Irene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would not understand,&rdquo; the shape
said, &ldquo;so I will, with your permission, omit
the explanation. If I gave up the diamonds,
I should be only a common drinking ghost&mdash;a
thing to be gossiped about and smiled
at.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You would be held in reverence as the
posthumous benefactor of your family,&rdquo; she
urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am better pleased with things as they
are. I have no great faith in the rewards of
benefactors; and the people benefited would
not belong to our circle, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are both selfish and cynical,&rdquo; Irene
declared. She fell to meditating what she
had better say to him, and meanwhile she
noted with satisfaction that the candle was
burning blue, a fact which, to her accustomed
eye, indicated that the ghost was a
spirit of standing most excellent in ghostly
ranks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To suffer the disapproval of one so
lovely,&rdquo; the remnant of the old-time gentleman
rejoined, &ldquo;is a misfortune so severe that
I cannot forbear reminding you that you are
not fully familiar with the conditions under
which I exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this unsatisfactory strain the conversation
continued for some time longer; and
when at length the ghost took its departure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and Irene retired to rest, she could not flatter
herself that she had made any especial
progress toward inducing the spirit to yield
the secret which it had so long and so carefully
guarded. The major&rsquo;s affections seemed
to be set with deathless constancy upon the
gems, and that most powerful of masculine
passions, vanity, to be enlisted in their defense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that it is of no use,&rdquo; Irene
sighed to herself; &ldquo;and yet, after all, he was
only a man when he was alive, and he cannot
be much more than that now when he is a
ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And greatly comforted by the reflection
that whatever is masculine is to be overcome
by feminine guile, she fell asleep.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>On the following afternoon Irene found herself
rowing on the river with the lieutenant.
She had declined his invitation to come, and
had immediately felt so exultant in the
strength of mind which had enabled her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
withstand temptation that she had followed
the refusal with an acceptance.</p>

<p>The day was deliciously soft and balmy.
A thin haze shut off the heat of the sun, while
a southerly breeze found somewhere a spicy
and refreshing odor, which with great generosity
it diffused over the water. The river
moved tranquilly, and any one capable of
being sentimental might well find it hard to
resist the influences of the afternoon.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was as ardently in love as it
is possible for a man to be who is at once a
soldier and handsome, and indeed more than
would have been expected from a man who
combined such causes of self-satisfaction. The
fact that Irene had a great deal of money,
while he had none, gave to his passion a hopelessness
from his point of view which much
increased its fervor. He gazed at his companion
with his great dark eyes as she sat in the
stern, his heavy eyebrows and well-developed
mustache preventing him from looking as silly
as might otherwise have been the case. Miss
Gaspic was by no means insensible to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
spell of the time and of the companionship in
which she found herself, but she was determined
above all things to be discreet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; she said, by way of keeping the
talk in safe channels and also of finding out
what she wanted to know, &ldquo;was search ever
made for the McHugh diamonds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Everything short
of pulling the house down has been tried.
Everybody in the family from the time they
were lost has had a hand at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not see&mdash;&rdquo; began Irene, when he
interrupted brusquely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nobody sees. The solution
of the riddle is probably so simple that
nobody will think of it. It will be hit upon
by accident some day. But, for the sake of
goodness, let us talk of something else. I
always lose my temper when the McHugh
diamonds are mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He relieved his impatience by a fierce spurt
at the oars, which sent the boat spinning
through the water; then he shook himself as
if to shake off unpleasant thoughts, and once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
more allowed the current to take them along.
Irene looked at him with wistful eyes. She
would have been so glad to give him all her
money if he would have it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me,&rdquo; she said at length, with
a faint air of self-consciousness, &ldquo;that you
wanted to say something to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young lieutenant flushed, and looked
between the trunks of the old trees on the
river-bank into the far distance. &ldquo;I have,&rdquo;
he responded. &ldquo;It is a piece of impertinence,
because I have no right to say it to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may say anything you wish to say,&rdquo;
Irene answered, while a vague apprehension
took possession of her mind at something in
his tone. &ldquo;Surely we have known each other
long enough for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the other blurted out with an
abruptness that showed the effort that it cost
him, &ldquo;you should be married, Irene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irene felt like bursting into tears, but with
truly feminine fortitude she managed to smile
instead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I getting so woefully old and faded,
then, Arthur?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>His look of reproachful denial was sufficiently
eloquent to need no added word.
&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you should
not be going on toward the time when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I shall be,&rdquo; she concluded his sentence
as he hesitated. &ldquo;Then, Arthur, why
don&rsquo;t you ask me to marry you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blood rushed into his face and ebbed
away, leaving him as pale as so sun-browned
a fellow could well be. He set his teeth together
over a word which was strangled in its
utterance, and Irene saw with secret admiration
the mighty grasp of his hands upon the
oars. She could be proud of his self-control so
long as she was satisfied of the intensity of his
feelings, and she was almost as keenly thrilled
by the adoring, appealing look in his brown
eyes as she would have been by a caress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the McHughs have
never yet been set down as fortune-hunters,
and I do not care to be the one to bring that
reproach upon the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a vilely selfish way of looking at it!&rdquo;
she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely it seems so to a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irene flushed in her turn, and for fully
two minutes there was no sound save that
of the water lapping softly against the boat.
Then Miss Gaspic spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; she said, in a tone so cold
that the poor lieutenant dared not answer
her, &ldquo;that the fact that you are a man prevents
you from understanding how a woman
feels who has thrown herself at a man&rsquo;s head,
as I have done, and been rejected. Take me
back to the shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he had not a word to answer.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>To have proposed to a man, and been refused,
is not a soothing experience for any
woman; and although the ground upon which
Arthur had based his rejection was one which
Irene had before known to be the obstacle
between them, the refusal remained a stubborn
fact to rankle in her mind. All the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
she nursed her wounded feelings, and
by the time midnight brought her once more
face to face with the ghost of the major, her
temper was in a state which nothing save
the desire to shield a lady could induce one
to call by even so mild a word as uncertain.</p>

<p>The spirit appeared as usual, saluting,
and tossing off bumpers from its shadowy
wine-glass, and it had swallowed at least a
dozen cups before Miss Gaspic condescended
to indicate that she was aware of its presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you stand there drinking in that
idiotic fashion?&rdquo; she demanded, with more
asperity than politeness. &ldquo;Once is quite
enough for that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I cannot speak until I have been
spoken to,&rdquo; the ghost responded apologetically,
&ldquo;and I have to continue drinking until
I have been requested to do something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink, then, by all means,&rdquo; Irene replied
coldly, turning to pick up a book. &ldquo;I only
hope that so much wine will not go to your
head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is sure to,&rdquo; the ghost said, in piteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
tones; &ldquo;and in all my existence, even when
I was only a man, I have never been overcome
with wine in the presence of a lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It continued to swallow the wraith of red
wine while it spoke, and Irene regarded it
curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An inebriated ghost,&rdquo; she observed dispassionately,
&ldquo;is something which it is so
seldom given to mortal to see that it would
be the greatest of folly to neglect this opportunity
of getting sight of that phenomenon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please tell me to go away, or to sit down,
or to do something,&rdquo; the quondam major
pleaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then tell me where the McHugh diamonds
are,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>A look of desperate obstinacy came into
the ghost&rsquo;s face, through which could unpleasantly
be seen the brass knobs of a tall
secretary on the opposite side of the room.
For some moments the pair confronted each
other in silence, although the apparition
continued its drinking. Irene watched the
figure with unrelenting countenance, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
length made the curious discovery that it was
standing upon tiptoe. In a moment more
she saw that it was really rising, and that
its feet from time to time left the carpet
entirely. Her first thought was a fear that
it was about to float away and escape, but
upon looking closer she came to the conclusion
that it was endeavoring to resist the tendency
to rise into the air. Watching more sharply,
she perceived that while with its right hand
it raised its inexhaustible wine-cup, with its
left it clung to the back of a chair in an evident
endeavor to keep itself down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be standing on tiptoe,&rdquo; she
observed. &ldquo;Were you looking for anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the wraith responded, in evident
confusion; &ldquo;that is merely the levitation consequent
upon this constant imbibing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irene laughed contemptuously. &ldquo;Do you
mean,&rdquo; she demanded unfeelingly, &ldquo;that the
sign of intoxication in a ghost is a tendency
to rise into the air?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is considered more polite in our circle
to use the term employed by the occultists,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the apparition answered somewhat sulkily.
&ldquo;We speak of it as &lsquo;levitation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do not belong to your circle,&rdquo; Irene
returned cheerfully, &ldquo;and I am not in sympathy
with the occultists. Does it not occur to
you,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that it is worth while to
take into consideration the fact that in these
progressive times you do not occupy the
same place in popular or even in scientific
estimation which was yours formerly? You
are now merely an hallucination, you know,
and there is no reason that I should regard
you with anything but contempt, as a mere
symptom of indigestion or of mental fatigue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can see that I am not an hallucination,
can you not?&rdquo; quavered the poor
ghost of the major, evidently becoming
dreadfully discouraged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is simply a delusion of the
senses,&rdquo; Irene made answer in a matter-of-fact
way, which, even while she spoke, she
felt to be basely cruel. &ldquo;Any physician would
tell me so, and would write out a prescription
for me to prevent my seeing you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But he could n&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the ghost said, with
pathetic feebleness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not know the physicians of to-day,&rdquo;
she replied, with a smile. &ldquo;But to drop
that, what I wished to say was this: does it
not seem to you that this is a good opportunity
to prove your reality by showing me
the hiding-place of the diamonds? I give
you my word that I will report the case to
the Psychical Research Society, and you will
then go on record and have a permanent
reputation which the incredulity of the age
cannot destroy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ghost was by this time in a state of
intoxication which evidently made it able only
with the utmost difficulty to keep from sailing
to the ceiling. It clung to the back of a chair
with a desperate clutch, while its feet paddled
hopelessly and helplessly in the air, in vain
attempts once more to get into touch with
the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Psychical Research Society is not
recognized in my circle,&rdquo; it still objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Irene exclaimed in exasperation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
&ldquo;do as you like! But what will be the
effect upon your reputation if you go floating
helplessly back to your circle in your present
condition? Is levitation in the presence of
ladies considered respectable in this society
of whose opinion you think so much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, to think of it!&rdquo; the spirit of the bygone
major wailed with a sudden shrillness
of woe which made even Miss Gaspic&rsquo;s blood
run cold. &ldquo;Oh, the disgrace of it! I will do
anything you ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irene sprang to her feet in sudden excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you show me&mdash;&rdquo; she began; but
the wavering voice of the ghost interrupted
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must lead me,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Give me
your hand. I shall float up to the ceiling if I
let go my hold upon this chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your hand&mdash;that is, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like
the feeling of ghosts,&rdquo; Irene replied. &ldquo;Here,
take hold of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She picked up a pearl paper-knife and
extended it toward the spirit. The ghost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
grasped it, and in this manner was led down
the chamber, floating and struggling upward
like a bird. Irene was surprised at the amount
of force with which it pulled at the paper-knife,
but she reflected that it had really
swallowed an enormous quantity of its ghostly
stimulant. She followed the directions of
the waving hand that held the wine-glass,
and in this way they came to a corner of the
room where the spirit made signs that it
wished to get nearer the floor. Irene pulled
the figure downward, until it crouched in the
corner. It laid one transparent hand upon
a certain panel in the wainscoting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search here,&rdquo; it said.</p>

<p>In the excitement of the moment Irene
relaxed her hold upon the paper-knife. Instantly
the ghost floated upward like a balloon
released from its moorings, while the
paper-knife dropped through its incorporeal
form to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; Irene cried after it. &ldquo;Thank
you so much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And like a blurred and dissolving cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
above her head the intoxicated ghost faded
into nothingness.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It was hardly to be expected that Irene,
flushed with the proud delight of having
triumphed over the obstinate ghost of the
major, could keep her discovery to herself
for so long a time as until daylight. It was
already near one in the morning, but on
going to her window, and looking across to
the wing of the house where the lieutenant&rsquo;s
rooms were, she saw that his light was still
burning. With a secret feeling that he was
probably reflecting upon the events of the
afternoon, Irene sped along the passage to
the door of Fanny&rsquo;s chamber, whom she
awakened, and dispatched to bring Arthur.</p>

<p>Fanny&rsquo;s characteristically feminine manner
of calling her brother was to dash into
his room, crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Arthur, Irene has found the McHugh
diamonds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was too incoherent to reply to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
questions, so that there was manifestly nothing
for him to do but to follow to the place
where Irene was awaiting them. There the
young couple were deserted by Fanny, who
impulsively ran on before to the haunted
chamber, leaving them to follow. As they
walked along the corridor, the lieutenant,
who perhaps felt that it was well not to
provoke a discussion which might call up
too vividly in Irene&rsquo;s mind the humiliation
of the afternoon, clasped her quite without
warning, and drew her to his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I can ask you to marry me,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;and I love you, Irene, with my whole
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her first movement was an instinctive
struggle to free herself; but the persuasion
of his embrace was too sweet to be resisted,
and she only protested by saying, &ldquo;Your
love seems to depend very much upon those
detestable old diamonds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Without
them I am too poor to have any right to
think of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried out in sudden terror,
&ldquo;suppose that they are not there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man loosened his embrace in
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not there!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Fanny said
that you had found them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet; only the ghost&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ghost!&rdquo; he echoed, in tones of
mingled disappointment and chagrin. &ldquo;Is
that all there is to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irene felt that her golden love-dream was
rudely shattered. She was aware that the
lieutenant did not even believe in the existence
of the wraith of the major, and although
she had been conversing with the spirit for
so long a time that very night, so great was
the influence of her lover over her mind that
she began at this moment to doubt the reality
of the apparition herself.</p>

<p>With pale face and sinking heart she led
the way into her chamber, and to the corner
where the paper-knife yet lay upon the floor
in testimony of the actuality of her interview
with the wraith. Under her directions the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
panel was removed from the wainscot, a
labor which was not effected without a good
deal of difficulty. Arthur sneered at the whole
thing, but he yet was good-natured enough
to do what the girls asked of him.</p>

<p>Only the dust of centuries rewarded their
search. When it was fully established that
there were no jewel-cases there, poor Irene
broke down entirely, and burst into convulsive
weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; Arthur said soothingly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel like that. We&rsquo;ve got on without
the diamonds thus far, and we can still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t the diamonds that I&rsquo;m crying
for,&rdquo; sobbed Irene, with all the naïveté
of a child that has lost its pet toy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no withstanding this appeal.
Arthur took her into his arms and comforted
her, while Fanny discreetly looked the other
way; and so the engagement was allowed to
stand, although the McHugh diamonds had
not been found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>But the next night Irene faced the ghost
with an expression of contempt that might
have withered the spirit of Hamlet&rsquo;s sire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you think it proper to deceive a lady?&rdquo;
she inquired scornfully. &ldquo;Is that the way in
which the gentlemen of the &lsquo;old school,&rsquo; of
which we hear so much, behaved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you should reflect,&rdquo; the wraith
responded waveringly, &ldquo;that you had made
me intoxicated.&rdquo; And, indeed, the poor spirit
still showed the effects of its debauch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot have been very thoroughly
intoxicated,&rdquo; Irene returned, &ldquo;or you would
not have been able to deceive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see,&rdquo; it answered, &ldquo;that I drank
only the ghost of wine, so that I really had
only the ghost of inebriation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But being a ghost yourself,&rdquo; was her
reply, &ldquo;that should have been enough to
intoxicate you completely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never argue with a lady,&rdquo; said the ghost
loftily, the subject evidently being too complicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for it to follow further. &ldquo;At least
I managed to put you as far as possible on
the wrong scent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it spoke, it gave the least possible turn
of its eye toward the corner of the room
diagonally opposite to that where it had disappeared
on the previous night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Irene, with sudden illumination.</p>

<p>She sprang up, and began to move from
its place in the corner an old secretary which
stood there. The thing was very heavy, but
she did not call for help. She strained and
tugged, the ghost showing evident signs of
perturbation, until she had thrust the secretary
aside, and then with her lamp beside
her she sat down upon the floor and began
to examine the wainscoting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come away, please,&rdquo; the ghost said piteously.
&ldquo;I hate to see you there on the floor.
Come and sit by the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;I am very
comfortable where I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt of the panels, she poked and pried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and for more than an hour she worked, while
the ghost stood over her, begging that she
go away. It was just as she was on the point
of giving up that her fingers, rubbing up and
down, started a morsel of dust from a tiny
hole in the edge of a panel. She seized a
hairpin from amid her locks, and thrust the
point into the little opening. The panel
started, moved slowly on a concealed hinge,
and opened enough for her to insert her
fingers and to push it back. A sort of closet
lay revealed, and in it was a pile of cases,
dusty, moth-eaten, and time-stained. She
seized the first that came to hand, and opened
it. There upon its bed of faded velvet blazed
the &ldquo;McHugh star,&rdquo; superb in its beauty
and a fortune in itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my diamonds!&rdquo; shrilled the ghost of
Major McHugh. &ldquo;Oh, what will our circle
say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will have the right to say that you
were rude to a lady,&rdquo; Irene answered, with
gratuitous severity. &ldquo;You have wasted your
opportunity of being put on record.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I am only a drinking ghost!&rdquo; the
wraith wailed, and faded away upon the air.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that on her wedding-day
Irene wore the &ldquo;McHugh star;&rdquo; and
yet, such is human perversity that she has
not only been convinced by her husband that
ghosts do not exist, but she has lost completely
the power of seeing them, although
that singular and valuable gift had come
to her, as has been said, by inheritance
from a great-aunt on her mother&rsquo;s side of
the family.</p>

<h2>A PROBLEM IN PORTRAITURE</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>&ldquo;It does not look like him,&rdquo; Celia Sathman
said, moving aside a little that the afternoon
light might fall more fully upon a portrait
standing unfinished upon the easel; &ldquo;and
yet it is unquestionably the best picture you
ever painted. It interests me, it fascinates
me; and I never had at all that feeling about
Ralph himself. And yet,&rdquo; she added, smiling
at her own inconsistency, &ldquo;it <em>is</em> like him. It
is n&rsquo;t what I call a good likeness, and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The artist, Tom Claymore, leaned back in
his chair and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right and wrong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
am a little disappointed that you don&rsquo;t catch
the secret of the picture. I knew Ralph
would n&rsquo;t understand, but I had hopes of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A puzzled look came into Celia&rsquo;s face as
she continued to study the canvas. Her companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
smoked a cigarette, and watched her
with a regard which was at once fond and
a little amused.</p>

<p>The studio was a great room which had
originally been devoted to no less prosaic
an occupation than the painting of oil-cloth
carpeting, great splashes of color,
which time and dust had softened into a
pleasing dimness, remaining to testify to its
former character. It stood down among the
wharves of old Salem, a town where even
the new is scarcely to be distinguished from
the old, and Tom had been delighted with
its roomy quiet, the play of light and shadow
among the bare beams overhead, and the ease
with which he had been able to make it serve
his purpose. He had done comparatively
little toward furnishing it for his summer
occupancy. He had hung a few worn-out
seines over the high beams, and placed here
and there his latest acquisitions in the way
of bric-à-brac, while numerous sketches were
pinned to the walls with no attempt at order.
On the door he had fastened a zither, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which the strings were struck by nicely balanced
hammers when the door was moved,
and in the still rather barn-like room, he
had established himself to teach and to paint
through the summer months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot make it out at all,&rdquo; Celia said
at last, turning away from the easel and
walking toward Claymore. &ldquo;It looks older
and stronger than Ralph, as if&mdash; Ah!&rdquo; she
interrupted herself suddenly, a new light
breaking in her face. &ldquo;Now I see! You
have been painting his possibilities. You
are making a portrait of him as he will
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As he may be,&rdquo; Claymore corrected her,
his words showing that her conjecture was in
truth the key to the riddle. &ldquo;When I began
to paint Ralph, I was at once struck by the
undeveloped state of his face. It seemed to
me like a bud that had n&rsquo;t opened; and I
began at once to try and guess what it would
grow into. I did n&rsquo;t at first mean to paint it
so, but the notion mastered me, and now I
deliberately give myself up to the impulse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s professional, but
it is great fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celia went back and looked at the picture
once more, but she soon returned to stand
leaning upon the tall back of the chair in
which her betrothed was sitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is getting too dark to see it,&rdquo; she
remarked; &ldquo;but your experiment interests
me wonderfully. You say you are painting
what his face may be; why not what his face
must be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; the artist replied, &ldquo;I am trying
to get in the best of his possibilities; to
paint the noblest there is in him. How can
I tell if he will in life realize it? He may
develop his worst side, you know, instead of
his best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celia was silent a moment. The darkness
seemed to have gathered quickly, rising
clouds cutting off the light of the after-glow
which had followed the sunset with delusive
promise. She leaned forward and laid her
finger-tips lightly upon Tom&rsquo;s forehead with
a caressing motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a clever man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is
fortunate you are a good one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he returned, almost brusquely,
though he took her hand and kissed it,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can lay claim to any
especial virtue. Are you remembering Hawthorne&rsquo;s
story of &lsquo;The Prophetic Pictures,&rsquo;
that you think my goodness particularly fortunate
in this connection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of replying, she moved across the
studio with her graceful, firm walk, which
had won Tom&rsquo;s deep admiration before he
knew even her name. She took up a light
old-fashioned silk shawl, yellow with time,
and threw it across her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go home,&rdquo; she remarked, as if
no subject were under discussion. &ldquo;I am
sure I don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking of
to stay here so late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is no time in sleepy old Salem,&rdquo;
was his response, &ldquo;so it can&rsquo;t be late; but if
you will go, I shall be proud to walk up with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He flung away the end of his cigarette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
locked the studio, and together they took their
way out of the region of wharves, along the
quaint old dinginess of Essex Street. It is
a thoroughfare full of suggestions of the past,
and they both were susceptible to its influences.
Here of old the busy life of Salem
flowed in vigorous current, laden with interests
which embraced half the globe; here
sailors from strange lands used to gather,
swarthy and bold, pouring into each other&rsquo;s
ringed ear talk of adventure wild and daring;
here merchants walked counting their gains
on cargoes brought from the far Orient and
islands of which even the names had hardly
grown familiar to the Western World.</p>

<p>Hawthorne has somewhere spoken of the
old life of New England as all too sombre,
and declared that our forefathers &ldquo;wove
their web of life with hardly a single thread
of rose-color or gold;&rdquo; but surely the master
was misled by the dimness gathered from
time. Into every old web of tapestry went
many a bright line of scarlet and green and
azure, many a woof of gold that time has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
tarnished and the dust of years dulled until
all is gray and faded. Along the memory-haunted
streets of Salem, from the first, went,
side by side or hand in hand, the happy
maiden and her lover; stepped the bridal
train; passed the young wife bearing under
her heart with fearful bliss the sweet secret
of a life other than her own; or the newly
made mother bore her first-born son through
a glory half sunlight and half dreams of his
golden future. In later days all the romance
of the seas, the teeming life which inspired
the tongue of the prophet&rsquo;s denouncing lyre
to break into rhapsodies of poetry, the stir of
adventurous blood, and the boldness of daring
adventurers have filled these old streets
with vivid and undying memories.</p>

<p>The artist and his companion were rather
silent as they walked, he studying the lights
and shadows with appreciative eye, and she
apparently absorbed in thought. At length
she seemed to come in her reverie to some
doubt which she needed his aid to resolve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she asked, rather hesitatingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
&ldquo;have you noticed any change in Ralph
lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Change?&rdquo; repeated Claymore interrogatively,
with a quick flash of interest in his
eyes despite the studied calmness of his
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He has n&rsquo;t been the same since&mdash;since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since when?&rdquo; the artist inquired, as she
hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it must be almost ever since we
came home and you began to paint him,&rdquo;
Celia returned thoughtfully; &ldquo;though I confess
I have noticed it only lately. Has n&rsquo;t it
struck you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her companion, instead of replying directly,
began carefully to examine the carving on
the head of his walking-stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget how slightly I knew him before,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;What sort of a change do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has developed. He seems all at once
to be becoming a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is twenty-eight. It is n&rsquo;t strange that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
there should be signs of the man about him,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he has always seemed so boyish,&rdquo;
Celia insisted, with the air of one who finds
it difficult to make herself understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely something has happened to
sober him,&rdquo; Tom answered, with an effort
to speak carelessly, which prevented him from
noticing that Celia flushed slightly at his
words.</p>

<p>They had reached Miss Sathman&rsquo;s gate,
and he held it open for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was very good of you to come this
afternoon,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;When will you take
your next lesson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you
know. Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The invitation was given with a certain
faint wistfulness, but he declined, and lifting
his hat, bade her good-night. She turned on
the doorstep and looked after him as his
strong, resolute figure passed down the street,
and a sigh escaped her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Tom will seem to me so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
reserved and cold after we are married,&rdquo; was
her thought.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>People in general thought Tom Claymore&rsquo;s
nature cold and reserved because his manner
was so. He was reticent perhaps to a fault,
but the reticent man who is cold is a monster,
and Tom was far from being anything so
disagreeable as that. His was the shy artistic
temperament, and the circumstances of his
rather lonely life had fostered a habit of
saying little while he yet felt deeply, and
since he took life seriously, he seldom found
himself disposed to open his heart in ordinary
conversation.</p>

<p>Even with his betrothed he had not yet
outworn the reserve which every year of his
life had strengthened, and Celia, despite her
betrothal, was not wholly free from the common
error of supposing that, because he did
not easily express his sentiment, he lacked
warmth of feeling. She had been his pupil in
Boston, and it was for the sake of being near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
her that he had established himself at Salem
for the summer, making a pretext of the fact
that he had promised to paint the portrait
of her cousin, Ralph Thatcher.</p>

<p>Tom Claymore could not have told at what
stage of his work upon this portrait he became
possessed of the idea that he had been
unconsciously painting rather the possibilities
than the realities of his sitter&rsquo;s face. At first
he smiled at the thought as a mere fanciful
notion; then he strove against it; but he ended
by giving his inspiration, or his whim, free
rein, and deliberately endeavoring to portray
the noblest manhood of which Ralph Thatcher&rsquo;s
face seemed to him to contain the germs.
He felt a secret impatience with the young
man, who, with wealth, health, and all the
opportunities of life, seemed still too much
a boy properly to appreciate or to use them;
and as the portrait advanced, the belief grew
in Claymore&rsquo;s mind that, when it was completed,
some effect might be produced upon
Thatcher by its showing him thus vividly
the possibilities of character he was wasting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
The artist did not, it is true, attach much
importance to this notion, but when once he
had given himself up to it, he at least found
much interest in following out his endeavor.
The idea of a sitter&rsquo;s being influenced by a
portrait is by no means a novel one among
painters, and Claymore took pains to have
Thatcher see the picture as soon as it got
beyond its early stages. He wanted it to
have to the full whatever influence was possible,
and he was eager to discover how soon
its departure from an exact likeness would
become apparent to the original.</p>

<p>A curious complication followed. It was
not long before it began to seem to Tom that
Ralph was growing up to the ideal the portrait
showed. At first he rejected the idea as
utterly fanciful. Then he recalled an experience
a brother artist had related to him in
Paris, where a girl who had been painted in
the dress of a nun worn at a fancy ball, came,
by brooding over the picture, to be so possessed
with a belief in her vocation that she
ended by actually taking the veil. The cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
were not exactly parallel, but Claymore saw
in them a certain similarity, in that both
seemed to show how a possibility might be
so strongly expressed on canvas as to become
an important influence in making itself an
actuality. He became intensely interested in
the problem which presented itself. He had
before this time remarked to Celia that Ralph
only needed arousing to develop into a noble
man, and he began to speculate whether it
could be within his power to furnish the
impulse needed&mdash;the filament about which
crystallization would take place all at once.
He worked slowly and with the utmost care,
taking pains to have Thatcher at the studio
as much as possible even on days when he
was not posing, so that the picture might
be constantly before his eyes; and of one
thing at least he was sure beyond the possibility
of a doubt&mdash; Ralph was certainly
developing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Post hoc sed non ergo propter hoc</i>,&rdquo; he
said to himself, in the Latin of his school
debating-society days; but secretly he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that in this case the effect was no less
&ldquo;because&rdquo; than &ldquo;after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the morning after Celia had talked
with her betrothed about the picture, Ralph
gave the artist a sitting. The young man
seemed so preoccupied that Tom rallied
him a little on his absence of mind, inquiring
if Thatcher wished his portrait to have
an air of deep abstraction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not thinking of that confounded
old picture at all,&rdquo; the young man responded,
smiling. &ldquo;I was merely&mdash;well, I do not
know exactly how to tell you what I was
doing. Do you ever feel as if the reflective
part of you, whatever that may be, had gone
into its office for private meditation and shut
your consciousness outside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tom answered; &ldquo;and I always
comfort myself for being excluded by supposing
that at least something of real importance
must be under consideration or it
would n&rsquo;t be worth the trouble to shut the
doors so carefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; returned the sitter. &ldquo;I had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
jolly old clerical uncle who used to lock the
door of his study and pretend to be writing
the most awe-inspiring sermons, when he
really was only having a well-fed nap. I am
afraid,&rdquo; he went on, with a sigh and a change
of manner, &ldquo;that there is little of real importance
has ever gone on in my mind. Do
you know, I am half inclined to hate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The artist looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hate me?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Why should you
hate me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you are everything that I am
not; because you succeed in everything and
I never did anything in my life; because at
this poker-table of life you win and I lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A strange tinge of bitterness showed itself
in Ralph&rsquo;s voice, and puzzled Claymore. It
was not like Thatcher to be introspective,
or to lament lost possibilities. The artist
rubbed his brush on his palette with a
thoughtful air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if that were so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see exactly why you should vent your disappointment
on me. I&rsquo;m hardly to blame, am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I? But of course what you say is nonsense
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense? It is n&rsquo;t nonsense. I&rsquo;ve done
nothing. I know nothing. I&rsquo;m good for
nothing; and the worst of it is that the girl
I&rsquo;ve wanted all my life realizes it just as well
as I do. She is n&rsquo;t a fool; and of course she
does n&rsquo;t care a rap about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The confession was so frankly boyish that
Claymore had a half-impulse to smile, but
the feeling in it was too evidently genuine
to be ignored. One thing at least was clear:
Ralph was at last beginning to be dissatisfied
with his idle, purposeless life. He had come
to the enlightenment of seeing himself as he
might look to the eyes of the woman he cared
for. The reflection crossed Claymore&rsquo;s mind
that some disappointment in love might have
brought about whatever change he had observed
in his sitter, and that any influence
which he had ascribed to the portrait had
in reality come from this. The thought
struck him with a ludicrous sense of having
befooled himself. It was as if some gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
palace of fancy, carefully built up and elaborated,
had come tumbling in ruins about
his head. He made a gesture, half comic,
half deprecatory, and laid down his palette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The light has changed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t paint any more to-day.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Claymore was intensely imaginative, and
he possessed all the sanguine disposition of
the artistic temperament, the power of giving
himself up to a dream so that it for
the time being became real. Matters which
the reason will without hesitation allow to
be the lightest bubbles of fancy are to such
a disposition almost as veracious fact; and
often the life of an imaginative man is
shaped by what to cold judgment is an
untenable hypothesis. The artist had not
in the least been conscious how strong a
hold the idea of awakening Ralph Thatcher
had taken upon his mind, until the doubt
presented itself whether the portrait had
in reality possessed any influence whatever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
He was not without a sense of humor, and he
smiled inwardly at the seriousness with which
he regarded the matter. He reasoned with
himself, half petulantly, half humorously;
sometimes taking the ground that his theory
had been merely a fantastic absurdity, and
again holding doggedly to the belief that it
was founded upon some fragment at least of
vital truth. He recalled vaguely a good many
scraps of modern beliefs in the power of suggestion;
then he came back to the reflection
that if Ralph was in love, no suggestion was
needed to cause a mental revolution.</p>

<p>Wholly to disbelieve in its own inspirations
is, however, hardly within the power of the
genuinely imaginative nature. Whatever his
understanding might argue, Tom, in the
end, would have been false to his temperament
had he not remained convinced that
he was right in believing that to some degree,
at least, the picture he was painting had influenced
his sitter. Without any consciously
defined plan, he got out a fresh canvas, and
occupied himself, when alone in the studio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
by copying Ralph&rsquo;s head, but with a difference.
As in the other picture he had endeavored
to express all the noblest possibilities
of the young man&rsquo;s face, in this he labored
to portray whatever potentiality of evil might
be found there. Every introspective person
has experienced the sensation of feeling that
a course of action is being followed as if by
some inner direction, yet without any clear
consciousness of the reason; and much as
might have come a hint of the intentions or
motives of another person, came to Tom the
thought that he was painting this second portrait
that its difference from the first might
show him upon what foundations rested his
fanciful theory. He wished, he told himself,
at least to see how far he had expressed a
personality unlike another equally possible.</p>

<p>As a faint shade on the artist&rsquo;s inner consciousness
rested, however, a feeling that this
explanation was not completely satisfactory.
He would have been shocked had he even
dreamed of the possibility that artistic vanity,
aroused by the doubt that it possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the power of moulding the life and destiny
of Ralph, had defiantly turned to throw its
influence into the other scale, to prove by its
power of dragging the sitter down that its
dominance was real. Had any realization of
such a motive come to Claymore, he would
have been horrified at a thought so evil; yet
he failed to push self-investigation far enough
to bring him to an understanding of his real
motives.</p>

<p>The painter worked steadily and with
almost feverish rapidity, and before the end
of the week he was able to substitute the
second portrait for the first when Ralph,
who had been out of town for a few days,
came for his next sitting. Tom was not
without a good deal of uneasy secret curiosity
in regard to the effect upon Thatcher
of the changed picture. He appreciated how
great the alteration really was, a difference
so marked that he had lacked the courage to
carry out his first intention of exhibiting the
new canvas to Celia. He excused himself for
hesitating to show her the portrait by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
whimsical pretext that it would not be the
part of a gentleman to betray the discreditable
traits of character he believed himself
to have discovered as among the possibilities
of her cousin&rsquo;s nature. What Ralph would
himself say, the painter awaited with uneasy
eagerness, and as the latter, after the customary
greetings, walked up to the easel and
stood regarding his counterfeit presentment,
Tom found himself more nervous than he
would have supposed possible.</p>

<p>Ralph studied the picture a moment in
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the devil,&rdquo; he burst out, &ldquo;have
you been doing to my picture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with it?&rdquo; the artist
asked, stepping beside him, and in turn fixing
his gaze on the portrait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Ralph replied,
with a puzzled air; &ldquo;but somehow or other
it seems to me to have changed from a rather
decent-looking phiz into a most accursedly
low-lived one. Do I look like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose a mirror would give a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
disinterested answer to that question than
I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claymore glanced up as he spoke, and
hardly repressed an exclamation of surprise.
Ralph&rsquo;s whole expression was changing to correspond
with that of the portrait before him.
Who has not, in looking at some portrait which
strongly impressed him, found in a little time
that his own countenance was unconsciously
altering its expression to correspond with
that portrayed before him; and the chances
that such a thing will occur must be doubly
great when the picture is one&rsquo;s own image.</p>

<p>A portrait appeals so intimately to the
personality of the person represented, human
vanity and individuality insist so strongly
upon regarding it as a part of self, that it
stands in a closer relation to the inner being
than can almost any other outward thing.
It is, in a sense, part of the original, and perhaps
the oriental prejudice against being
portrayed, lest in the process the artist may
obtain some sinister advantage, is founded
upon some subtle truth. It can hardly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
possible that, with the keen feeling every man
must have in regard to his portrait, any one
should fail to be more or less influenced by
the painter&rsquo;s conception of him, the visible
embodiment of the impression he has made
upon another human mind; and since every
picture must contain something of the personality
of the artist, it follows that a portrait-painter
is sure to affect in some degree the
character of his sitters. It would rarely happen
that this influence would be either intentional
or tangible, but must it not always exist?</p>

<p>Claymore stood for a little time watching
Ralph&rsquo;s face; then he walked away, and
returned with a small mirror which he put
in the latter&rsquo;s hand. Thatcher looked at the
reflection it offered him, and broke into a
hard laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it does look like
me. I never realized before that I was such
a whelp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo; Claymore rejoined briskly,
taking the glass from him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense.
Take your place and let&rsquo;s get to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>On the afternoon of the same day Celia came
into the studio with her face clouded. She
received her lover&rsquo;s greetings in an absent-minded
fashion, and almost before the musical
tinkle of the zither on the door which
admitted her had died away, she asked
abruptly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world have you been doing
to Ralph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? Nothing but painting him. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he came down here this morning
in a perfectly heavenly frame of mind. He
has been in Boston to see about some repairs
on his tenement-houses at the North End
that I&rsquo;ve been teasing him to make ever since
the first of my being there last winter; and
he came in this morning to say he thought
I was right, and he was going to take hold
and do what I wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Tom, as she broke
off with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And after he &rsquo;d been down here for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sitting, he came back so cross and strange;
and said he&rsquo;d reconsidered, and he did n&rsquo;t
see why he should bother his head about the
worthless wretches in the slums. I can&rsquo;t see
what came over him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should you hold me responsible
for your cousin&rsquo;s vagaries?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course you are not,&rdquo; Celia replied,
with a trace of petulance in her tone; &ldquo;but
I am so dreadfully disappointed. Ralph has
always put the whole thing off before, and
now I thought he had really waked up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Claymore suggested, &ldquo;it is
some new phase of his ill-starred love affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Sathman flushed to her temples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know why you choose to say
that,&rdquo; she answered stiffly. &ldquo;He never speaks
to me of that now. He is too thoroughly a
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Tom burst out, in genuine amazement.
&ldquo;Good heavens! It was n&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celia looked at him in evident bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did n&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Ralph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
has been in love with me ever since we were
in pinafores. I did n&rsquo;t speak of it because it
did n&rsquo;t seem fair to him; but I supposed, of
course, that was what you meant when you
spoke. I even thought you might be jealous
the least bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claymore turned away and walked down
the studio on pretense of arranging a screen.
He felt as if he had stabbed a rival in the
back. Whether by his brush he had really
an influence over Thatcher, or the changes
in his sitter were merely coincidences, he had
at least been trying to affect the young man,
and since he now knew Ralph as the lover of
Celia, his actions all at once took on a different
character, and the second portrait seemed
like a covert attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ralph is so amazingly outspoken,&rdquo; Celia
continued, advancing toward the easel and
laying her hand on the cloth which hung
before her cousin&rsquo;s portrait, &ldquo;that I wonder
he has not told you. He is very fond of you,
though, he naively says, he ought not to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, she lifted the curtain which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
hid the later portrait of Ralph. She uttered
an exclamation which made Claymore, whose
back had been turned, spring hastily toward
her, too late to prevent her seeing the picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what have you done
to Ralph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tone pierced Claymore to the quick.
The words were almost those which Celia
had used before, but now reproach, grief, and
a depth of feeling which it seemed to Tom
must come from a regard keener than either
gave them a new intensity of meaning. The
tears sprang to Miss Sathman&rsquo;s eyes as she
looked from the canvas to her lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how could you
change it so? Ralph does not look like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Claymore answered, his embarrassment
giving to his voice a certain severity.
&ldquo;This is the reverse of the other picture.
This is the evil possibility of his face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He recovered his composure. Despite his
coldness of demeanor, there was a vein of
intense jealousy in the painter&rsquo;s nature, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
tingled at the tone in which his betrothed
spoke of her cousin. He had more than once
said to himself that, despite the fact that
Celia might be more demonstrative than
he, his love for her was far stronger than
hers for him. Now there came to him the
conviction, quick and unreasonable, that although
she might not be aware of it, her
deepest affection was really given to Ralph
Thatcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you paint it, Tom?&rdquo; Celia
pursued. &ldquo;It is wicked. It really does not
in the least resemble Ralph. I suppose you
could take any face and distort it into wickedness.
Where is the other picture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without a word Tom brought the first
portrait and set it beside the second. Celia
regarded the two canvases in silence a moment.
Her color deepened, and her throat
swelled. Then she turned upon Claymore
with eyes that flashed, despite the tears which
sprang into them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wicked and cruel!&rdquo; she said
bitterly. &ldquo;I hate you for doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom turned pale, and then laughed unmirthfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take it very much to heart,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>The tears welled more hotly in her eyes.
She tried in vain to check them, and then
with a sob she turned and walked quickly
from the studio, the zither tinkling, as the
door closed after her, with a gay frivolity that
jarred sharply on Tom Claymore&rsquo;s nerves.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>It was nearly a fortnight before Tom saw
Celia again. For a day or two he kept away
from her, waiting for some sign that her
mood had softened and that she regretted
her words. Then he could endure suspense
no longer and called at the house, to discover
that she had gone to the mountains for a
brief visit. He remembered that he had been
told of this journey, and he reflected that
Celia might have expected him to come and
bid her good-by. His mental attitude toward
her had been much the same as if there had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
been some actual quarrel, and now he said
to himself that, after all, there had been
nothing in their last interview to justify this
feeling. He alternately reproached himself
and blamed her, and continually the condition
of things became more intolerable to
him.</p>

<p>His temper was not improved when Ralph,
at one of the sittings, which continued steadily,
mentioned in a tone which seemed to the
artist&rsquo;s jealous fancy rather boasting, that he
had received a letter from his cousin. Tom
frowned fiercely, and painted on without
comment.</p>

<p>Claymore was working steadily on the
second portrait, which was rapidly approaching
completion. He said to himself that if
his theory was right, and the reflection of
his worst traits before a man&rsquo;s eye could
influence the original to evil, he would be
avenged upon Ralph for robbing him of
Celia, since this portrait of Thatcher was to
have a place in the young man&rsquo;s home. He
also reflected that in no way else could he so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
surely wean Celia from an affection for her
cousin, as by bringing out Ralph&rsquo;s worst
side. He despised himself for what he was
doing, but as men sullenly yield to a temptation
against which all their best instincts
fight, he still went on with his work.</p>

<p>He naturally watched closely to see what
effect the portrait was already having on his
sitter. Whether from its influence or from
other causes, Ralph had grown morose and
ungracious after Celia&rsquo;s departure, and Tom
was certainly not mistaken in feeling that
he was in the worst possible frame of mind.
Even the fact that his cousin had written to
him did little to change his mood, a fact that
Tom, sore and hurt at being left without
letters, noted with inward anger.</p>

<p>The two men were daily approaching that
point where it was probable that they would
come into open conflict. Ralph began to
devise excuses for avoiding the sittings, a
fact that especially irritated the artist, who
was anxious to complete the work. The
whole nature of their relations toward each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
other had undergone a change, and all frankness
and friendliness seemed to have gone
out of it. Sometimes Claymore felt responsible
for this, and at others he laughed at the
idea that he had in any way helped to alter
Ralph. He was uneasy and unhappy, and
when a couple of weeks had gone by without
a word from Celia, he resolved that he would
follow her to the mountains, and at least put
an end to the suspense which was becoming
intolerable.</p>

<p>He sent word to Thatcher that he was
going out of town for a few days, packed
his valise, and went down to his studio to
put things to rights for his absence. He arranged
the two or three matters that needed
attention, looked at his watch, and found
that he had something over an hour before
train time. He started toward the door of
the studio, hesitated, and then turned back
to stand in front of the easel and regard the
nearly completed portrait of Ralph Thatcher.</p>

<p>It was a handsome face that looked out
at him, and one full of character; but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the full lips was an expression of sensuality
almost painful, and the eyes were selfish and
cruel. The artist&rsquo;s first feeling was one of
gratified vanity at the cleverness with which
his work had been done. He had preserved
the likeness, and scarcely increased the apparent
age of his sitter, while he had carried
forward into repulsive fullness the worst possibilities
of which he could find trace in the
countenance of the original. As he looked,
a cruel sense of triumph grew in Claymore&rsquo;s
mind. He felt that this portrait was the sure
instrument of his revenge against the man
who had robbed him of the love of his betrothed.
He considered his coming interview
with Celia, and so completely was he possessed
of the belief that he had lost her, that
he looked forward to the meeting as to a
farewell.</p>

<p>At the thought a sudden pulse of emotion
thrilled him. He saw Celia&rsquo;s beautiful, high-bred
face before him, and there came into
his mind a sense of shame, as if he were
already before her and could not meet her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
eyes. The sting of the deepest humiliation
a high-minded man can know, that of standing
condemned and degraded in his own
sight, pierced his very soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is myself and not Ralph that I have
been harming,&rdquo; ran his thought. &ldquo;It has
never occurred to me that, even if I was
dragging him down, I had flung myself into
the slime to do it. Good heavens! Is this
the sort of man I am? Am I such a sneak
as to lurk in the dark and take advantage of
the confidence he shows by putting himself
into my hands! Celia is right; she could not
be herself and not prefer him to the blackguard
I have proved myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However fanciful his theory in regard to
the effect of the portrait upon Thatcher might
be, Tom was too honest to disguise from himself
that his will and intention had been to do
the other harm, and to do it, moreover, in an
underhanded fashion. Instead of open, manly
attack upon his rival, he had insidiously
endeavored to work him injury against which
Ralph could not defend himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing I have really accomplished,&rdquo;
groaned poor Tom to himself, &ldquo;is
to prove what a contemptible cur I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took from his pocket his knife, opened
it, and approached the canvas. Then that
strong personal connection between the artist
and his work which makes its defense almost
identical with the instinct of self-preservation,
made him pause. For an instant he wavered,
moved to preserve the canvas, although he
hid it away; then with desperate resolution,
and a fierceness not unlike a sacred fury, he
cut the canvas into strips. So great was the
excitement of his mood and act that he panted
as he finished by wrenching the shreds of
canvas from the stretcher.</p>

<p>Then he smiled at the extravagance of his
feelings, set the empty stretcher against the
wall, and once more brought to light the
original portrait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he set the
picture on the easel, &ldquo;I can at least go to her
with a decently clean conscience, if I am a
fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It was well on toward sunset when Claymore
reached the mountain village where Celia
was staying with a party of friends. All the
hours of his ride in the cars he had been
reviewing his relations toward her. With
his imaginative temperament he was sure to
exaggerate the gravity of the situation, and
he was firmly convinced that by the destruction
of the portrait he had virtually renounced
his betrothed. He recalled jealously the
many signs Celia had given of her interest
in her cousin, and he settled himself in the
theory that only Ralph&rsquo;s boyishness and
apparent want of character had prevented
her cousin from winning her love. Looking
back over the summer and recalling how
Thatcher had advanced in manliness, how
his character had developed, and Celia&rsquo;s
constant appreciation of his progress, Claymore
could not but conclude, with an inward
groan, that although she was pledged to him,
her affection was really given to his rival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether Celia was aware of the true state
of her feelings, Tom could not determine.
Her silence of the last fortnight had perplexed
and tormented him; and he felt sure
that in this time she could not have failed
to reflect deeply upon the situation. He believed,
however whimsical such a theory might
seem, that his only chance of holding her
was by bringing home to her the dark side
of Ralph&rsquo;s character, as he was convinced
he had been the means of showing her the
best traits of her cousin. The effect of the
portraits had become to him a very real and
a very important factor in the case, and
although he was at heart too good to regret
that he had destroyed the second picture, he
was not without a feeling of self-pity that fate
had forced upon him the destruction of his
own hopes. The logical reflection that, if
his ideas were true, he had himself chosen
to take up the weapon by which he was in
the end wounded, did not occur to him, and
would probably have afforded him small
consolation if it had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>A servant directed him down a wood-path
which led to a small cascade, where he was
told he should find Miss Sathman. As he
came within sound of the falling water, he
heard voices, and pressing on, he was suddenly
brought to an abrupt halt by recognizing
the tones of Ralph Thatcher. What the
young man was saying Tom did not catch,
but the reply of Celia came to his ears with
cutting distinctness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does it seem to you honorable,
Ralph,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to follow me here and talk
to me in this way, when you know I am engaged
to another man, and he your friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No man is my friend that takes you away
from me!&rdquo; Thatcher returned hotly. &ldquo;And
besides, I happen to know you have quarrelled
with him. You have n&rsquo;t written to him since
you came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not quarrelled with him,&rdquo; Celia
answered. &ldquo;Oh, Ralph, I have always believed
you were so honorable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honorable! honorable!&rdquo; repeated the
other angrily. &ldquo;Shall I let you go for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
whimsical fancy that it is not honorable to
speak to you? I have loved you ever since
we were children, and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Miss Sathman interrupted, &ldquo;have
never loved anybody in that way but Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woodland swam before Claymore&rsquo;s
eyes. Instinctively, and hardly conscious what
he was doing, he drew himself aside out of
the path into the thicket. What more was
said, he did not know. He was only aware
that a moment or two later Ralph went alone
by the place where he lay hidden, and then
he rose and went slowly toward the cascade
and Celia.</p>

<p>She was sitting with her back toward him,
but as she turned at the sound of his footsteps,
the look of pain in her eyes changed suddenly
into a great joy.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>It was nearly a year before Tom told Celia the
whole story of the two portraits. The temptation
and the effects of his paltering with
it were so real in his mind that he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
bring himself to confess until he had made
such effort as lay in his power at reparation.
He finished the original picture without more
sittings, for Ralph, much to the artist&rsquo;s relief,
kept away from the studio. Then he left
Salem, saying to himself that his presence
there might drive Ralph from home, where
Tom wished him to remain, that the influence
of the face, if it really existed, might help him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Celia said thoughtfully,
&ldquo;whether the changes in Ralph came from
the pictures or from his disappointment; but
in either case I can see how real the whole
was to you, and I am glad you stood the test;
although,&rdquo; she added, smiling fondly upon
her husband, &ldquo;I should have known from
the first that you would n&rsquo;t fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must acknowledge,&rdquo; Tom responded,
replying to the latter portion of her
remark by a caress, &ldquo;that Ralph has come
out splendidly in the last year&mdash;since he has
had that portrait to look at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied musingly, &ldquo;and he is
fast growing up to the picture.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE KNITTERS IN THE SUN</h2>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The spinsters and the knitters in the sun.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i22"><cite>Twelfth Night</cite>, ii, 4.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<p>The mellow light of the October sun fell
full upon the porch of the stately old Grayman
house, and the long shadows of the Lombardy
poplars pointed to the two silvery
haired women who sat there placidly knitting.</p>

<p>The mansion dated back to colonial times.
That it had been erected before public sentiment
was fully settled in regard to the proper
site of the village might be inferred from its
lonely position on the banks of the river
which flowed through the little town a mile
away. The funereal poplars, winter-killed and
time-beaten now in their tops, had been in
their prime half a century ago, yet they were
young when compared to the house before
which they stood sentinel. From the small-paned
windows of this dwelling Graymans
whose tombstones where long sunken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
rusted with patient moss had seen British
vessels sailing up the river with warlike intent,
and on the porch where the women sat knitting
peacefully, Captain Maynard Grayman
had stood to review his little company of
volunteers before leading them against the
redcoats, and had spoken to them in fiery
words of the patriots whose blood had but
a week before been shed at Lexington. The
place had still the air of pre-Revolutionary
dignity and self-respect.</p>

<p>As the poplars had steadily cast their
sombre shadows upon the Graymans, father
and son and son&rsquo;s son, as generation after
generation they lived and died in the old
mansion, so had the Southers no less constantly
remained the faithful servants of the
family. They had seen the greatness of the
masters wane sadly from its original splendors,
the family pride alone of all the pristine
glories remaining unimpaired; they had
striven loyally against the fate which trenched
upon the wealth and power of the house; and
they had seen money waste, reputation fade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
until now even the name was on the verge
of extinction, and the family reduced to a
bed-ridden old man querulously dwelling in
futile dreams of vanished importance and the
lovely and lonely daughter who wore out her
life beside him.</p>

<p>As the Graymans diminished, the Southers,
perhaps from the very energy with which
they strove to aid the fallen fortunes of their
masters, had waxed continually. The change
which keeps from stagnation republican society,
abasing the lofty and exalting the
lowly, could not have had better illustration
than in the two families. It was from no
necessity that old Sarah was still the servant
of the house; a servant, in truth, with small
wage, and one who secretly helped out the
broken revenues of her master. Dollar for
dollar, she could have out-counted the entire
property of her employers; and might have
lived where and as she pleased, had she been
minded to have servants of her own. In old
Sarah&rsquo;s veins, however, flowed the faithful
Souther blood, transmitted by generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of traditionary adherents of the Grayman
family; and neither the persuasions of her
children, who felt the quickening influence
of the new order of things, nor the amount
of her snug account in the village savings
bank, could tempt the steadfast creature
from her allegiance. When long ago she had
married her cousin, an inoffensive, meek
man, dead now a quarter of a century, she
had made it a condition that she should not
abandon her service; and her position in
the Grayman mansion, like her name, had remained
practically unchanged by matrimony.</p>

<p>She was a not uncomely figure as she sat
in the October sunlight knitting steadily,
her hair abundant although silvery, and her
figure still alert and erect. From her dark
print gown to the tips of her snowy cap-strings
she was spotlessly neat, while an air
of mingled energy and placidity imparted a
certain piquancy to her bearing. Her active
fingers plied the bright needles with the deftness
of long familiarity, and from time to
time her quick glance swept in unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
inspection over the row of shining tin pans
ranged along the porch wall, over the beehives
in their shed not far away, robbed now
of their honey, over the smooth-flowing river
beyond, and over her sister who knitted beside
her. She had the air of one accustomed
to responsibility and used to watching sharply
whatever went on about her. She bestowed
now and then a brief look upon the yellow
cat asleep at her feet with his paws doubled
under him, and one instinctively felt that
were he guilty of any derelictions in relation
to the dairy, her sharp eye would have detected
it in some tell-tale curl of his whiskers.
She scanned with a passing regard of combined
suspicion and investigation the ruddy
line of tomatoes gaining their last touch of
red ripeness on the outside of the window-ledge,
her expression embodying some vague
disapproval of any fruit of which the cultivation
was so manifestly an innovation
on good old customs. In every movement
she displayed a repressed energy contrasting
markedly with the manner of the quiet knitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
beside her in that strange fashion so often to
be found in children of the same parents.</p>

<p>The second woman was little more than a
vain shadow from which whatever substance
it had ever possessed had long since departed.
Hannah West was one of those ciphers to
which somebody else is always the significant
figure. In her youth she had been the shadow
of her sister, and when her husband departed
this life, she had merely returned to her first
allegiance in becoming the shadow of Sarah
Souther once more. She was a tiny, faded
creature, who came from her home in the
village to visit her sister upon every possible
occasion, much as a pious devotee might
make a pilgrimage to a shrine. She believed
so strongly and so absolutely in Sarah that
the belief absorbed all the energy of her
nature and left her without even the power of
having an especial interest in anything else.
What Sarah Souther did, what she thought,
what she said, what were the fortunes and
what the opinions of her children, with such
variations as could be rung on these themes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
formed the subject of Mrs. West&rsquo;s conversation,
as well as of such transient and
vague mental processes as served her in
place of thought. The afternoons which she
passed in aimless, placid gossip with her sister
were the only bits of light and color in
her monotonous existence, to be dwelt upon
in memory with joy as they were looked forward
to with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo; know,&rdquo; Hannah remarked, after an
unusually long interval of silence this afternoon,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s set me thinkin&rsquo; so much &rsquo;bout
George and Miss Edith as I hev&rsquo; lately.
Seems ef things took hold o&rsquo; me more the
older I get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A new look of intelligence and alertness
came into Sarah&rsquo;s face. She knit out the last
stitches upon her needle, and looked down
over the river, where a little sail-boat was trying
to beat up to the village with a breeze so
light as to seem the mere ghost of a wind.
The story of the hapless loves of her son
and Edith Grayman was sure to be touched
upon some time in the course of every afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
when she and Hannah sat together, and
she was conscious of having to-day a fresh
item to add to the history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a letter from George yesterday,&rdquo;
she said, approaching her news indirectly that
the pleasure of telling it might last the longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; asked Hannah, almost with
animation. &ldquo;I want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sarah answered, a softer look
coming into her bright gray eyes. &ldquo;Yes, and
a good letter it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George was always a master hand at
writin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Hannah responded. &ldquo;He is a regular
mother&rsquo;s son. He would n&rsquo;t tell a lie to
save his right hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sarah responded, understanding
perfectly that this apparently irrelevant allusion
to the veracity of her son had a direct
bearing upon the difficulties which had beset
his wooing; &ldquo;when Mr. Grayman asked him
if he had been makin&rsquo; love to Miss Edith,
he never flinched a mite. He spoke up like a
man. There never was a Souther yet that I
ever heard of that &rsquo;u&rsquo;d lie to save himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>She laid her knitting down upon her lap
and fixed upon the little boat a regard which
seemed one of the closest attention, yet which
saw not the white sloop or the dingy sail with
its irregular patch of brown. Some tender
memory touched the eternally young motherhood
in her aged bosom, and some vision of
her absent son shut out from her sense the
view of the realities before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would n&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been his mother&rsquo;s son
if he had &rsquo;a&rsquo; lied,&rdquo; Hannah remarked, with
a sincerity so evident that it took from the
words all suspicion of flattery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or his father&rsquo;s either,&rdquo; Sarah said. &ldquo;I
never set out that Phineas had much go to
him, but he was a good man, and he was as
true as steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; her sister assented, as she would
have assented to any proposition laid down
by Mrs. Souther, &ldquo;yes, he was that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat for a moment in silence. Sarah
resumed her knitting, and once more became
conscious of the lagging sloop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s likely Ben Hatherway&rsquo;s boat,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
she remarked. &ldquo;If he don&rsquo;t get on faster,
he&rsquo;ll get caught in the turn of the tide and
carried out again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hannah glanced toward the boat in a
perfunctory way, but she was too deeply
interested in the theme upon which the talk
had touched to let it drop, and her mind was
hardly facile enough to change so quickly
from one subject to another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did George say?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You
said it was a good letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the mother answered, &ldquo;it was a
regular good letter, if I do say it that had n&rsquo;t
ought. He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo; home?&rdquo; echoed Hannah, in a
twitter of excitement. &ldquo;I want to know!
Comin&rsquo; home himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno what you mean by comin&rsquo; home
himself,&rdquo; Sarah replied, with a mild facetiousness
born of her joy at the news the
letter had brought; &ldquo;but &rsquo;t ain&rsquo;t at all likely
he&rsquo;ll come home nobody else. He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,
&rsquo;t any rate. It&rsquo;ll be curious to see how him
and Miss Edith &rsquo;ll act. It&rsquo;ll be ten years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
since they said good-by to one another, and
ten years is considerable of a spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happen he&rsquo;ll be changed,&rdquo; Hannah observed.
&ldquo;Ten years does most usually change
folks more or less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happen,&rdquo; Sarah responded, in a graver
and lower tone, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll find her changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if to give opportunity for the testing of
the truth of this remark, the slight figure of
Edith Grayman at that moment appeared at
the head of the steep and crooked stairway
which led from the chambers of the old house
into the kitchen close by the porch door.
She was a woman whose face had lost the
first freshness of youth, although her summers
counted but twenty-seven. Perhaps it
was that the winters of her life had been so
much the longer seasons. There was in her
countenance that expression of mild melancholy
which is the heritage from generations
of ancestors who have sadly watched the
wasting of race and fortune, and the even
more bitter decay of the old order of things
to which they belong. She was slender and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
graceful in shape, with a stately and gracious
carriage, and the air of the patrician
possibly a faint shade too marked in her
every motion.</p>

<p>As she came slowly down the time-stained
stairway, her fair hair twisted high upon her
shapely head, her lips slightly pressed together,
and her violet eyes pensive and introspective,
Edith might have passed for the
ghost of the ancestress whose rejuvenated
gown of pale blue camlet she wore.</p>

<p>The long shadows of the lugubrious Lombardy
poplars had already begun to stretch
out in far-reaching lines, as if laying dusky
fingers on the aged mansion, and the sun
shone across the river with a light reddened
by the autumn hazes. The knitters, as they
turned at the sound of Edith&rsquo;s footfall, shone
in a sort of softened glory, and into this they
saw her descend as she came down the winding
stair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father is asleep,&rdquo; Miss Grayman said,
stepping into the porch with a light tread. &ldquo;I
am going down to the shore for a breath of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
air before the night mist rises. You will hear
father&rsquo;s bell if he wakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She moved slowly down the path which
led toward the river, and the regards of the
two old women followed her as she went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a born lady,&rdquo; Sarah said, not without
a certain pride as of proprietorship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is that,&rdquo; Hannah acquiesced. &ldquo;Does
she know he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just ain&rsquo;t had the sconce to tell her,&rdquo;
was the response. &ldquo;Sometimes &rsquo;t seems just
as though I&rsquo;d ought to tell her, and then agen
&rsquo;t seems if &rsquo;t would n&rsquo;t do no kind or sort of
good. Two or three times she&rsquo;s sort of looked
at me &rsquo;s if she had an idea something was
up, but even then I could n&rsquo;t bring it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When &rsquo;s he comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any day now. He was in Boston when
he wrote, and he&rsquo;s likely to be on the boat
&rsquo;most any day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hannah laid down her knitting for a
moment in the breathless excitement of
this announcement. The romance of young
George Souther and Edith Grayman had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
thrilled her as nothing in her own experience
could have done, so much more real and
so much more important were these young
people to her mind than was her own personality.
For ten years the tale, brief and simple
though it was, had for her been the most
exciting of romances, and the possibility of
the renewal of the broken relations between
the lovers appealed to her every sense.</p>

<p>The story of the ill-starred loves of the
young couple was really not much, although
the two gossips knitting in the sun had spun
its length over many a summer&rsquo;s afternoon.
Young, lovely, and lonely, Edith Grayman
had responded to the love of the manly,
handsome son of her nurse as unconsciously
and as fervently as if the democratic theories
upon which this nation is founded had
been for her eternal verities. She had been
as little aware of what was happening as is
the flower which opens its chalice to the sun,
and the shock of discovery when he dared to
speak his passion was as great as if she had
not felt the love she scorned. Indeed, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
probable that the sudden perception of her
own feelings aroused her to a sense of the
need she had to be determined, if she hoped
to hold her own against her lover&rsquo;s pleading.
She was beset within and without, and had
need of all her strength not to yield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She gave in herself ten years ago,&rdquo; Sarah
commented, following the train of thought
which was in the mind of each of the sisters
as they watched Edith&rsquo;s graceful figure
disappear behind a thicket of hazel bushes,
turning russet with the advance of autumn.
&ldquo;She stood out till that night George was
upset in that sail-boat of his and we thought
he was never comin&rsquo; to. It makes me kind
o&rsquo; creepy down my back now to recollect the
screech she give when she see him brought
in; an&rsquo; mercy knows I felt enough like
screechin&rsquo; myself, if it had n&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been for
knowin&rsquo; that if I did n&rsquo;t get the hot blankets,
there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t nobody to do it. She could n&rsquo;t
deny that she was in love with him after
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she sent him off,&rdquo; interposed Hannah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in the tone of one repeating an objection
which persistently refused to be explained to
her satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sarah returned; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what you
always say, when you know as well &rsquo;s I do
that that was to please her father; and there
he lies bed-rid to-day just as he did then,
and just as sot in his way as ever he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pair sighed in concert and shook their
gray heads. Of the real significance of the
romance which lay so near them they were
almost as completely ignorant as was the great
yellow cat, who opened his eyes leisurely as
Hannah let fall her ball of yarn, and then,
considering that upon the whole the temptation
to chase it was not worth yielding to,
closed the lids over the topaz globes again
with luxurious slowness. Themselves part
of the battle between the old order and the
new, the good creatures were hardly aware
that such a struggle was being waged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said,&rdquo; Sarah murmured, bringing
forward another scrap of the story, &ldquo;that
she never &rsquo;d marry him &rsquo;s long &rsquo;s her father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
objected, and if I don&rsquo;t know that when once
Leonard Grayman &rsquo;s sot his mind on a thing
to that thing he &rsquo;ll stick till the crack o&rsquo;
doom, then I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about him;
that&rsquo;s all. She won&rsquo;t go back on her word,
and he won&rsquo;t let her off, and that&rsquo;s just the
whole of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Hannah agreed, sniffing sympathetically,
&ldquo;they won&rsquo;t neither of &rsquo;em change
their minds; that you may depend upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d object if he was in his coffin, I do
believe,&rdquo; Sarah continued, with a curious mixture
of pride in the family and of personal
resentment. &ldquo;The Graymans are always
awful set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George must be considerable rich,&rdquo; Hannah
observed, in a tone not without a note of
reverence; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s sent you a power o&rsquo; money,
first and last, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Considerable,&rdquo; the other replied, with conscious
elation. &ldquo;I never used none of it. He
kept sendin&rsquo; till I told him it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no manner
o&rsquo; mortal use; the family would n&rsquo;t let
me use it for them, and I had more &rsquo;n I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
what to do with anyway. I&rsquo;ve got more &rsquo;n
&rsquo;nough to bury me decenter &rsquo;n most folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I s&rsquo;pose y&rsquo; have,&rdquo; Hannah assented.</p>

<p>The knitters sat silent a little time, perhaps
reflecting upon the thoughts which the
mention of the last rites for the dead called
up in their minds. The shadows were growing
longer very fast now, and already the
afternoon had grown cooler.</p>

<p>Suddenly a step sounded on the graveled
walk, and a firmly built, handsome man of
thirty-two or three came around the house
and neared the porch where the old women
sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George!&rdquo; cried old Sarah, so suddenly
that the cat sprang up, startled from his
dreams of ancestral mice. &ldquo;Where on earth
did you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; Hannah exclaimed,
rather irrelevantly, in her excitement dropping
a stitch in her knitting.</p>

<p>She was instantly aware of the misfortune,
however, and while the mother and son exchanged
greetings after their ten years&rsquo; separation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Hannah occupied herself in endeavors
to pick up the loop of blue yarn which her
purblind eyes could scarcely see in the dimming
light. When the stitch had been secured,
she proffered her own welcome in sober
fashion, being, in truth, somewhat overcome
by this stalwart and bearded man whom she
remembered as a stripling. The two women
twittered about the robust newcomer, who
took his seat upon the porch steps, pouring
out each in her way a flood of questions or
exclamations to which he could hardly be
expected to pay very close attention.</p>

<p>After a separation of ten years the greetings
were naturally warm, but the Southers
were not a folk given to demonstrativeness,
and it was not to the surprise of Mrs. Souther
that before many minutes had passed her
son said abruptly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; his mother said, in a tone
in which were oddly mingled pride, remonstrance,
and fondness, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you got over
that yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he responded briefly, but laying his
hand fondly on that of his mother. &ldquo;Where
is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like as not she won&rsquo;t see you,&rdquo; his mother
ventured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sent for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two women stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sent for you?&rdquo; they echoed in unison,
their voices raised in pitch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, rising and throwing back
his strong shoulders in a gesture his mother
remembered well. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I
should n&rsquo;t tell you, mother. She said she had
been proud as long as she could bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The situation was too overwhelmingly surprising
for the women to grasp it at once.
Their knitting lay neglected in their laps
while they tried to take in the full meaning
of this wonderful thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t her pride,&rdquo; old Sarah said softly.
&ldquo;&rsquo;T &rsquo;s his; but she would n&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;
against her father if she was to be killed for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she in the house?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No; she &rsquo;s down to the shore,&rdquo; his mother
answered, with a gasp.</p>

<p>At that moment sounded from the house
the tinkle of a bell. The two women started
like guilty things surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my good gracious!&rdquo; ejaculated Hannah
under her breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; demanded George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his bell,&rdquo; Mrs. Souther answered.
&ldquo;He wants me. You need n&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he must have heard&mdash;&rdquo; began Hannah
breathlessly. Then she stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he heard me?&rdquo; George
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he &rsquo;d wake up about this time anyway,&rdquo;
his mother said. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added,
with a novel note of rebellion in her voice,
&ldquo;what if he did? You have a right to come
to see me, I should hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the bell tinkled. Old Sarah turned
to go into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find her down to the shore,&rdquo; she
repeated.</p>

<p>He turned away at her word, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
long, rapid strides took the path which Miss
Edith had taken earlier. The mother paused
to look at him from the threshold. Hannah
knitted on with a feverish haste and a frightened
countenance. For a third time the bell
called, now more imperatively, and Sarah
mounted the crooked stairway followed by
the frightened gaze of her sister.</p>

<p>In the cool and shaded chamber into
which Sarah went, a chamber fitted with
high-shouldered old mahogany furniture,
the youngest piece of which had known the
grandfathers of the withered old man who
lay in the carved bed, the air seemed to her
electric with dreadful possibilities. Mr. Grayman
was sitting up in bed, his scant white
locks elfishly disheveled about the pale parchment
of his face, his eyes unnaturally bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; he demanded,
with fierce querulousness. &ldquo;Why did n&rsquo;t you
come when I rang?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not at first reply, but busied herself
with the medicine which it was time for
him to take.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose voice did I hear?&rdquo; the old man
demanded, as soon as he had swallowed the
teaspoonful of liquid she brought him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hannah is here,&rdquo; she answered briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I heard a man&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; he continued,
his excitement steadily mounting. &ldquo;I
know who it was! I know who it was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie down,&rdquo; his nurse said sternly. &ldquo;You
know the doctor said your heart would n&rsquo;t
stand excitement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was George!&rdquo; he exclaimed shrilly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an impudent&mdash;&rdquo; A fit of gasping
choked him, but he struggled fiercely to go
on. &ldquo;If she speaks to him, if she looks at
him even, I&rsquo;ll curse her! I&rsquo;ll curse her! I&rsquo;ll
come back from my grave to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A convulsive gasping ended the sentence.
He tore at his throat, at his breast, he struggled
dreadfully. Old Sarah supported him
in her arms, and tried to aid him, but nothing
could save him from the effect of that paroxysm.
With one tremendous final effort, the
old man threw back his head, drew in his
breath with a frightful gasp, then forced it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
out again in the attempt to utter a last malediction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curse&mdash;&rdquo; The shrill word rang through
the chamber, but it was followed by no other.
A strong, wrinkled hand, a hand that for a
lifetime had worked faithfully for him and
his, was pressed over his mouth. He choked,
gasped, and then the male line of the Grayman
family was extinct.</p>

<p>In the meantime Hannah had been sitting
on the porch, knitting like an automaton,
and staring at the yellow cat with eyes full
of dazed terror. She heard the disturbance
in the chamber above, but it came to her
very faintly until that last shrill word rang
down the ancient stairway. Then she dropped
her knitting in complete consternation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness!&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;Oh,
goodness gracious me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was swept away completely by the
sudden turmoil which had come to trouble
the peaceful afternoon. With the leveling
tendencies of modern days Hannah had become
in a way familiar, as she had for a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
lived at a distance in a town of some size,
and of late years in the village, where the
unruffled existence of the old Grayman place
might almost seem as remote as the life of
another century. But Hannah never made
any application of modern principles to &ldquo;the
family.&rdquo; The Graymans were an exception
to any rules of social equality or democratic
tendency. The presumption of her nephew
in raising his eyes to Miss Edith had always
been all but incredible to the simple old
soul; and to understand that a lady of the
Grayman stock could for a moment have
entertained feelings warmer than those of
patronage for a Souther was utterly beyond
Hannah&rsquo;s power. She had heard George
say that Miss Edith had sent for him; but
she had understood it no more than she would
have understood a vision of the Apocalypse.
The slow steps by which the girl had come
to be in revolt against the family traditions,
to be ready to abandon her heart-breaking
resolutions, and to summon her lover, could
have been made credible to old Hannah only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
on the theory of madness. She sat there in
the silence which had followed that shrill cry
from the chamber of death, dazed and half
cowering, unable to think or to move.</p>

<p>At last she saw George Souther returning
alone by the river-path. The brightness was
gone from his face, and his lips were contracted
sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She &rsquo;s sent him away again,&rdquo; Hannah
West said within herself. &ldquo;She had to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The universe seemed to her to be righting
itself again. Some monstrous aberration might
for a moment have come upon Miss Grayman,
but the stars in their courses were not
more steadfast than the principles of the
blood. Hannah breathed more freely at the
sight of her nephew&rsquo;s drawn face. She wished
him no ill, but she could not regard this desire
of his as not unlike that of a madman who
would pluck the moon from the sky. She
instinctively accepted his evident failure as
a proof that sanity still existed in the world,
and that the moral foundations of society
were still undestroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is mother?&rdquo; George asked abruptly,
as he came upon the porch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t come down yet,&rdquo; Hannah answered,
her thin hands going on with the
knitting like a machine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; he said simply.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at that instant the figure of his mother
appeared on the stairway. She came out
upon the porch, bent, gray, cowering. As
her eye caught the face of her son, however,
she straightened herself and a new look
came into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Miss Edith?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>George came to her and took her hand
gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must n&rsquo;t blame
her. She can&rsquo;t break her father&rsquo;s heart. She
has sent me away again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother looked at him quietly, but with
eyes that shone wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need n&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she announced calmly.
&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; echoed her son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; cried Hannah shrilly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sarah responded, with increasing
calmness. &ldquo;He had one of his paroxysms.
The doctor said he&rsquo;d go off in one of
them. You&rsquo;d better go to Miss Edith and
tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hannah rose from her chair as if the feebleness
of age had come upon her suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor said he must n&rsquo;t be excited,&rdquo;
she quavered. &ldquo;Did he know George was
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The son, who had half turned away,
wheeled back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that what killed him?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>Old Sarah straightened herself with a
supreme effort. The very strain of uttering
a falsehood and of the dreadful secret which
must darken her soul for the rest of her life
gave to her words an added air of sincerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did n&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He went
off as peaceful as a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her son waited for nothing more, but once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
more hastened down the river-path. Hannah
stood as if transfixed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Sarah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sarah looked at her with a wild regard.
For a moment was silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you heard nothing. He
did not say it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaned against the doorpost and looked
at her right hand strangely, as if she expected
to see blood on it. Then she stood
erect again, squaring her shoulders as if to
a burden accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be still,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mechanically old Hannah, bowed and
bewildered, began to do up her knitting in
the fading autumnal afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is growing chilly,&rdquo; she muttered shiveringly.</p>
<hr class="l1" />

<h2>A COMEDY IN CRAPE</h2>


<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Sterns stoutly,
turning the seam of the flannel shirt she was
making for some unknown soldier, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe any one of the three was ever really
engaged to Archie Lovell. He went round
with all of them some, of course; but that
was n&rsquo;t anything&mdash;with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur from the group about her told
at least of sympathy with her point of view,
and assent showed itself in the remark with
which Mrs. Small continued the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful easy for a girl to put on mourning
when a man&rsquo;s dead, and say she&rsquo;s been
engaged to him; but if any one of &rsquo;em had
been engaged to Archie Lovell while he was
alive, she&rsquo;d have bragged enough of it at the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The murmur of assent was more pronounced
now, and one or two of the members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of the Soldiers&rsquo; Aid Society expressed
in word their entire agreement of this opinion.
The ladies who made up the society usually
improved the opportunities afforded by their
meetings to discuss all the gossip of Tuskamuck,
and the matter which they were now
talking over in the corner of Dr. Wentworth&rsquo;s
parlor was one which had caused much excitement
in the little community. It was in
the days of the Civil War, and anything connected
with the soldiers aroused interest,
but a combination of romance and gossip
with a tragedy in the field contained all the
elements of the deepest sensation. News
had come after the battle of Chickamauga
of the death of Archie Lovell, and although
this was followed by a vague rumor that he
might perhaps be among the missing rather
than the killed, it had never been really disproved.
As time had gone on without tidings
of the missing man, his death had been accepted,
and even his aunt, Old Lady Andrews,
whose idol he had been, and who clung
to hope as long as hope seemed possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
had given him up at last. She had ordered a
memorial stone to be placed in the village
graveyard, and the appearance of the marble
tablet seemed in a way to give official sanction
to the belief that Archie Lovell would never
again carry his bright face and winning smile
about the village streets, and that nevermore
would he drive the gossips of Tuskamuck to
the verge of desperation by flirting so markedly
with a dozen girls that they could by no
means keep track of him or decide what his
real preference&mdash;if he had one&mdash;might be.</p>

<p>Whatever loss the gossips sustained by
his death, however, was soon made up, for
no sooner was the news of his loss known
than three girls, one after the other, announced
their engagement to the dead hero,
and one after the other donned widow&rsquo;s
weeds in his memory. So many girls had
been the recipients of Archie&rsquo;s multifarious
attentions that it would have been easy for
almost any one of Tuskamuck&rsquo;s maidens to
bring forward such a claim with some show
of probability; but unfortunately, by the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of 1863 too many damsels had done this
sort of thing for the posthumous announcement
of an engagement to be received with
entire solemnity or assured credence. A sort
of fashion of going into mourning for dead
soldiers had set in, and undoubtedly many a
forlorn damsel by a tender fiction thus gratified
a blighted passion which had never before
been allowed to come to light. Cynic wits
declared that it added a new terror to a soldier&rsquo;s
death that he could never tell who
would, when he was unable to deny it, claim
to have been betrothed to him; and when,
as in the present case, three disconsolate
maidens wore crape for the same man, the
affair became too absurd even for the responsive
sympathies of war-time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way things are going on,&rdquo; observed
Mrs. Drew, a stern woman with a hard eye,
&ldquo;the men are getting so killed off that the
only satisfaction a girl can get anyway is to
go into mourning for some of &rsquo;em; and I
don&rsquo;t blame &rsquo;em if they do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quality of the remark evidently did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
not please her hearers, who could hardly
bear any slightest approach to light speaking
concerning the tragedy in which the
nation was involved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it was any one of the three,&rdquo; Mrs.
Cummings declared, after a brief silence,
&ldquo;it was Delia Burrage. He used to go round
with her all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more &rsquo;n he did with Mattie Seaton,&rdquo;
another lady observed. &ldquo;He used to see
Mattie home from singing-school most of
the time that winter before he enlisted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, when Delia presented
the flag to the company the night before they
went off, he was with her all the evening.
Don&rsquo;t you remember how we had a supper
in the Academy yard, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I remember. I guess I was on
the committee; but he used to go with Mattie
lots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sent Mary Foster that wooden chair
he carved in camp,&rdquo; spoke up another lady,
coming into the field as a champion of the
third of the mourners who were so conspicuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
advertising their grief to an unbelieving
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that was a philopena; so that don&rsquo;t
count. She told me so herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The case was argued with all the zeal and
minuteness inseparable from a discussion at
the Tuskamuck Soldiers&rsquo; Aid Society, and
at last, when everybody else began to show
signs of flagging, a word was put in by Aunt
Naomi Dexter. She had throughout sat
listening to the dispute, now and then throwing
in a dry comment, wagging her foot and
chewing her green barège veil after her fashion,
and looking as if she could tell much,
if she were but so disposed. Aunt Naomi
scorned sewing, and was the one woman who
was privileged to sit idle while all the others
were busy. She never removed her bonnet
on these occasions, the fiction being that she
had only dropped in, and did not really belong
to the society; but gossip was to Aunt
Naomi as the breath of her nostrils, and she
would have died rather than to absent herself
from a company where it might be current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how many girls Archie
Lovell was engaged to,&rdquo; she now remarked
dryly. &ldquo;I dare say he did n&rsquo;t himself; and
for all I know, he was engaged to all three of
those geese that are flying the black flag for
him. But I can tell you the girl he really
wanted to marry, and she is n&rsquo;t in black,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies all regarded her with looks of
lively curiosity and interrogation; but she
rolled the sweet morsel of gossip under her
tongue, and evidently had no intention of
being hurried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Mrs. Cummings demanded
at length, in a tone which indicated that no
more trifling would be endurable.</p>

<p>Aunt Naomi moistened her lips with an
air like that of a cat in contemplation of a
plump young sparrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see who there is that&rsquo;s any more
likely to have been engaged to him than
Mattie,&rdquo; the champion of that young lady
asserted combatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d no more have married her than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
would me,&rdquo; Aunt Naomi asserted contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it, then?&rdquo; Mrs. Smith demanded
impatiently.</p>

<p>Aunt Naomi looked about on the eager
faces, and seemed to feel that interest had
been brought up to its culmination point so
that it was time to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy Turner,&rdquo; she pronounced briefly.</p>

<p>The name was received with varying expressions
of face, but few of the ladies had
any especial comment to offer in word. Some
scorned the idea, and the champions of the
three mourners still stood by their guns;
but the new theory plainly had in it some
force, for the women were all evidently impressed
that in this suggestion might lie the
real solution to the vagaries of Archie Lovell&rsquo;s
multitudinous wooing. As Mrs. Cummings
said, however, Nancy Turner was a girl who
kept her own counsel, and if she had indeed
been engaged to the missing soldier, nobody
would ever be the wiser for it. It was discouraging
to the gossips to be confronted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
with a mystery which they could have so
little hope of ever solving, and the talk gradually
turned to other topics, this one remaining
as available as ever to be taken up whenever
conversation might languish.</p>

<p>The Sunday following this meeting of the
Soldiers&rsquo; Aid Society was a warm and beautiful
spring day, which invited to the open
air. Public morality in Tuskamuck was
narrow in its interpretations, and among
other restrictions it imposed was the impropriety
of walking on Sunday except by strolling
in the village graveyard. The theory,
if carefully investigated, would have been
found, in all probability, to have its roots in
some Puritan notion that youth in its thoughtlessness
would be sobered and religiously
inclined by the sight of the grassy mounds,
the solemnly clumsy mortuary inscriptions,
and the general reminders of death. In practice
the fact did not entirely justify such a
theory, for the graceless young people instinctively
sought for amusement rather than for
spiritual enlightenment, chatted and laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
as loudly as they dared, examined the epitaphs
for those that might by any distortion
of their original intent be made ludicrous,
and exchanged jokes in most unsabbatical
fashion. They even indulged thoughtlessly,
in the very midst of these grim reminders of
a life wherein is neither marriage nor giving
in marriage, in little rustic flirtations, and
eagerly picked up morsels of gossip by sharp
observation of young couples strolling oblivious
of watching eyes among the graves.</p>

<p>To-day the desire to see the newly set stone
which had been placed over the empty mound
which was to preserve the memory of Archie
Lovell attracted an unusually large number
of village folk to turn into the graveyard
after afternoon service, and an exciting
whisper had gone about that the three disconsolate
betrothed damsels had all come
to church with flowers. The little groups
drifted slowly through the weatherbeaten
gate behind the church, but the very first of
them were deterred by seeing a black-robed
figure laying already her bunch of geraniums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
on the grave. Delia Burrage, who sang in the
choir, had, as was afterward told from one end
of the town to the other, slipped down the
gallery stair without waiting for the benediction,
and so had managed to be first in the
field.</p>

<p>The gathering groups of villagers had
hardly time to note with what tender care
the bereft Delia arranged her bunch of scarlet
blossoms at the foot of the still snowy marble
slab than they were set aquiver with delicious
excitement by the sight of a second crape-enshrouded
figure that came to the spot, also
bearing flowers. Mary Foster carried in her
black-gloved hands a cluster of white pyrethrums,
a favorite house-plant in Tuskamuck.
Miss Foster came up on the side of the mound
opposite to the first comer, and humbly laid
her offering below the red geraniums; but
although she was thus forced to place her
flowers farther from the stone than the other,
she was evidently determined not to be outdone
in devotion. She fell on her knees, and
bowed her face in her handkerchief in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
grief so dramatic that Miss Burrage was left
far behind, and had no resource but to come
to her knees in turn, in a weak imitation of
her rival.</p>

<p>The spectators were by this time in a sort
of twitter of gratified excitement, and exchanged
many significant looks and subdued
comments. Those boldest pressed nearer to
the scene of action, keenly curious to hear
if word passed between the bereaved ladies.
Excitement rose to its highest when slowly
down the long path came Martha Seaton,
more voluminously draped in sable weeds
than either of the others. She carried a wreath
of English ivy, and a sort of admiring shudder
ran through the neighbors as they saw that
to this funeral wreath Miss Seaton had sacrificed
the growth of years of careful window
gardening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! She &rsquo;s cut her ivy!&rdquo; one of them
gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, so she has! Well, for the land&rsquo;s
sake!&rdquo; responded another, too much overwhelmed
to speak coherently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust Mattie Seaton for not letting anybody
get ahead of her!&rdquo; a third commented,
in accents of admiration.</p>

<p>Human curiosity could not keep aloof at
a moment such as this, and as Mattie advanced
toward the Lovell lot, the neighbors
followed as if irresistibly impelled. They
closed in a ring around the spot when she
reached it, and they looked and listened with
an eagerness so frank as almost to be excusable.
They could see that the earlier comers
were watching from behind the handkerchiefs
pressed to their eyes, and with the approbation
which belongs to a successful dramatic
performance the audience noted also the
entire coolness with which Miss Seaton
ignored them until she stood close to the
drooping pair. Then she flung back her long
veil of crape with a sweeping gesture, and
with a regal glance of her gypsyish black eyes
looked first at them and then at the flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you so much for bringing
flowers,&rdquo; she said, in a voice evidently so
raised that her words should be distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
heard by the ring of spectators. &ldquo;Archie was
so fond of them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words gave no chance of reply, and
an audible chuckle arose from the listening
throng, so obviously had her tone and manner
made the other mourners outsiders.
When Mattie slowly and deliberately moved
around the headstone until she stood behind
it, hung her wreath on its rounded top, and
bowed her head upon it with her handkerchief
covering her eyes, she had completely
taken possession of the whole situation. As
one of the young men of the town inelegantly
observed, she was &ldquo;boss of that grave and
the others did n&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; As if in a carefully
planned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tableau vivant</i>, she stood, a drooping
figure of anguish, while the other two had
become merely kneeling ministrants upon
her woe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if that ain&rsquo;t the beatin&rsquo;est!&rdquo;
chuckled old Ichabod Munson, puckering
his leathery face into an ecstasy of wrinkles.
&ldquo;Gosh, I wish Archie Lovell could see that.
He&rsquo;d be &rsquo;most willin&rsquo; to get kilt for a sight o&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
his three widders, an&rsquo; that Seaton girl comin&rsquo;
it so over t&rsquo; others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d think he was a Mormon or a Turk,&rdquo;
observed Miss Charlotte Kendall, with her
deep, throaty chuckle that not even the
solemnity of the graveyard could subdue.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d see the fun of it. Poor Archie! He
did love a joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The situation over the tombstone was one
from which retreat to be effective must be
speedy. Mattie Seaton was apparently the
only one to appreciate this. But for a few
moments did she remain with her forehead
bent to the slab; then she kissed the cold
marble feverishly; and in a voice broken,
but still in tones easily audible to the listening
neighbors, she said to the kneeling girls:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much for your sympathy;&rdquo;
and before they could reply she had dropped
again the cloud of crape over her face, and was
moving swiftly away up the path to the gate.</p>

<p>Never was exit more dramatically effective.
The pair left behind exchanged angry glances,
then with a simultaneous impulse started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to their feet, and as quickly as possible got
away from the sight of their fellow townsfolk.
They might be silly, but they were not so
foolish as not to know how ridiculous they
had been made to look that afternoon.</p>

<p>It was only a few days after this that the
village was stirred by the news that Old
Lady Andrews, who so mourned for Archie,
who had adored the handsome, good-natured,
selfish, flirtatious dog all his life, had gone
South in the hope of recovering his remains,
and of bringing them home to rest beneath
the stone she had erected. The village pretty
generally sympathized with the desire, but
thought the chance of success in such a
quest made the undertaking a piece of hopeless
sentiment. The time since the news of
Archie&rsquo;s death was already considerable, his
fate from the first had been uncertain, and
the chances of the identification of his grave
seemed exceedingly small.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I figure Ol&rsquo; Lady Andrews would &rsquo;a&rsquo;
done better to stay to hum,&rdquo; &rsquo;Siah Appleby
expressed the sentiment of the town in saying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
&ldquo;Like&rsquo;s not &rsquo;f she finds out anythin&rsquo; certain,&mdash;which
&rsquo;t ain&rsquo;t all likely she will,&mdash;she&rsquo;ll
find Archie was just hove into a trench &rsquo;long
with a lot more poor fellers, an&rsquo; no way o&rsquo;
sortin&rsquo; out their bones short o&rsquo; the Day o&rsquo;
Judgment. She&rsquo;d sot up a stone to him, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
she&rsquo;d a nawful sight better let it go at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sentiment of the matter touched some,
but the years of war had brought so much of
grief and suffering that most had settled into
a sort of dull acquiescence unless the woe
were personal and immediate. The neighbors
sympathized with the feeling of grief-stricken
Old Lady Andrews, but so many
husbands and fathers, brothers and sons and
lovers, had vanished in unidentified graves
that the nerves of feeling were benumbed.
It would in the early years of the war have
been unbearable to think of a friend as lying
in an unnamed grave in the South; now it
seemed simply a part of the inevitable misery
of war.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;three widows,&rdquo; as the village folk
unkindly dubbed them, were less in evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
after the episode in the graveyard. They
avoided each other as far as possible, and
were evidently not unaware that they were
not taken very seriously by their neighbors.
They perhaps knew that jests at their expense
were in circulation, like the grim remark of
Deacon Daniel Richards, that he did not see
how any one of them could claim more than
a &ldquo;widow&rsquo;s third&rdquo; of Archie&rsquo;s memory. They
kept rather quiet, at least; and the weeks
went by uneventfully until the departure of
Old Lady Andrews again drew attention to
the story.</p>

<p>The old lady went alone, and once gone
she sent no word back to tell how she fared
on her quest. Now that her nephew was
missing, she had no immediate family; and
she wrote to none of her townsfolk. The
spring opened into summer as a bud into a
flower, and life at Tuskamuck went on with
its various interests, but no one was able to
do more than to speculate upon her movements
or her success.</p>

<p>One afternoon in June the Soldiers&rsquo; Aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Society came together for its weekly gathering
in the vestry. The meeting had been appointed
at the house of the Widow Turner,
but Nancy Turner had been suddenly called
out of town, and her mother, somewhat of
an invalid, had not felt equal to the task
of entertaining without her. The bare room,
with its red pulpit and yellow settees, had
a forlorn look, despite the groups of busy
women and girls scattered over it; but its
chilling influence could not check the flow of
conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear where Nancy Turner&rsquo;s
gone?&rdquo; one woman asked of the group in
which she sat. &ldquo;She must have gone very
suddenly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understood there was sickness somewhere,&rdquo;
another responded vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s her aunt over at Whitneyville,&rdquo;
a third suggested. &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Turner told
me in the spring she was real feeble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Turner herself &rsquo;s real frail. She did n&rsquo;t
feel well enough to come this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where &rsquo;s Aunt Naomi?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Cummings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;most five o&rsquo;clock, and she
almost always comes about three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Wright, with a
laugh and her quick, bright glance, &ldquo;you may
depend upon it she&rsquo;s getting news somewhere.
She&rsquo;ll come in before we go home,
with something wonderful to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if in intentional confirmation of the
words, Aunt Naomi at that moment appeared
in the doorway. Her shrewd old face showed
satisfaction in every wrinkle, and from beneath
the unfailing veil of green barège
draped from her bonnet over the upper left-hand
corner of her face her eyes positively
twinkled. She took a deliberate survey of the
room, and then with her peculiar rocking
gait moved to the group which had been discussing
her absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Aunt Naomi,&rdquo; Mrs.
Cummings greeted her. &ldquo;We were just
wondering what had become of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I said,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Wright audaciously,
&ldquo;that you must be getting some wonderful
piece of news.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Naomi hitched up her shawl behind
with a grasshopper-like motion of her elbows,
and sat down with a wide grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this time you were right,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I was hearing Old Lady Andrews tell
about her trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Lady Andrews?&rdquo; echoed the ladies.
&ldquo;Has she got home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; she got here this noon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And nobody but you knew it!&rdquo; ejaculated
Mrs. Cummings.</p>

<p>They all regarded Aunt Naomi with undisguised
admiration, in every look acknowledging
her cleverness in discovering what
had been hid from the rest of the village. She
smiled broadly, and seemed to drink in the
sweet odor of this surprise and their homage
as an idol might snuff up grateful fumes of
incense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she bring home the body?&rdquo; Mrs.
Cummings asked after a moment, in a voice
becomingly lowered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did,&rdquo; Aunt Naomi answered,
with a chuckle of levity which seemed almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
indecent. &ldquo;She had a dreadful time finding
out anything; but she had friends at Washington&mdash;her
husband had cousins there,
you know&mdash;and at last she got on the
track.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was he buried?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Naomi paused to wag her foot and
to nibble at the corner of her green veil in
a way common to her in moments of excitement.
She looked around in evident enjoyment
of the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was n&rsquo;t buried anywhere,&rdquo; she said,
with a grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Wright excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he was n&rsquo;t dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was n&rsquo;t dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; only taken prisoner. He was
wounded, and he&rsquo;s been in Libby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is he now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s all right now. He&rsquo;s coming over
here to show himself, and see his friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were hardly spoken when in
the doorway appeared the well-known figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of Archie Lovell. He wore the uniform of a
lieutenant, he was pale and worn, but handsomer
than ever. On his arm was a blushing
damsel in a hat with a white feather, her
face all smiles and dimples. An exclamation
went up from all over the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Archie Lovell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was followed almost immediately by
another:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Nancy Turner&rsquo;s with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s Nancy Lovell,&rdquo; announced Aunt
Naomi, in a voice audible all over the vestry.
&ldquo;They were married in Boston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bridal couple advanced. All about the
room the ladies rose, but instead of greeting
the newcomers, they looked at the &ldquo;three
widows,&rdquo; and waited as if to give them first
an opportunity of accosting their mate, thus
returned as if from the very grave, and so
inopportunely bringing another mate with
him. Miss Burrage and Miss Foster shrank
from sight behind the backs of those nearest
to them; but Mattie Seaton swept impulsively
forward with her hand extended cordially.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Her crisp black hair curled about her
temples, her eyes shone, and her teeth flashed
between her red lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Archie, dear,&rdquo; she said, in her
clear, resonant voice, &ldquo;we thought we had
lost you forever. We all supposed you were
dead, and here you are only married. Let
me congratulate you, though after being
engaged to so many girls, it must seem queer
to be married to only one!&mdash;and you,
Nancy,&rdquo; she went on, before Archie could
make other reply than to shake hands; &ldquo;to
think you got him after all, just because you
went ahead and caught him! I congratulate
you with all my heart; only look out for
him. He&rsquo;ll make love to every woman he
sees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bent forward and kissed the bride
before Mrs. Lovell could have known her
intention, and turned quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Delia,&rdquo; she called across the vestry;
&ldquo;come, Mary! There&rsquo;s nothing for us to do
but to go home and take off our black. We
may have better luck next time!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>With this ambiguous observation, which
might have been construed to cast rather a
sinister reflection upon the return to life of
the young lieutenant, she swept out of the
vestry, complete mistress of the situation; and
although Archie Lovell always strenuously
denied that he had ever been engaged to any
woman besides the one he married, a general
feeling prevailed in Tuskamuck that no girl
could have carried it off with a high hand
as Mattie did, if she had not had some sort of
an understanding to serve her as a support.</p>

<p>But never again while the Civil War lasted
did a girl in Tuskamuck put on black for
a lover unless the engagement had been publicly
recognized before his death.</p>

<h2>A MEETING OF THE PSYCHICAL
CLUB</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The meeting of the Psychical Club had
been rather dull, and it was just as the members
were languidly expecting an adjournment
that the only interesting moment of
the evening came. The papers had been
more than usually vapid, and, as one man
whispered to another, not even a ghost could
be convicted upon evidence so slight as that
brought forward to prove the existence of
disembodied visitants to certain forsaken
and rat-haunted houses. At the last moment,
however, the President, Dr. Taunton, made
an announcement which did arouse some
attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we go,&rdquo; he said, smiling with the
air of one who desires it to be understood
that in what he says he distinctly disclaims
all personal responsibility, &ldquo;it is my duty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
submit to the Club a singular proposition
which has been made to me. A gentleman
whom I am not at liberty to name, but who
is personally known to many&mdash;perhaps to
most&mdash;of you, offers to give to the Club an
exhibition of occult phenomena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The members roused somewhat, but too
many propositions of a nature not dissimilar
had ended in entire failure and flatness for
any immediate enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are his qualifications?&rdquo; a member
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not dream that he possessed any,&rdquo;
Dr. Taunton responded, smiling more broadly.
&ldquo;Indeed, to me that is the interesting thing.
I had never suspected that he had even the
slightest knowledge or curiosity in such matters,
and still less that he made any pretensions
to occult powers. The fact that he is
a man of a position so good and of brains so
well proved as to make it unlikely that he
would gratuitously make a fool of himself is
the only ground on which his proposition
seems to me worth attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he propose to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does not say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have given some sort of idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said only that he was able to perform
some tricks&mdash;experiments, I think, was his
word; or no&mdash;he said demonstrations. He
thought they would interest the members.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he say why he offered to do them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No further than to observe not over
politely that he was weary of some of the
nonsense the Club circulated, and that he
would therefore take the trouble to teach
them better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The members smiled, but some colored a
little as if the touch had reached a spot somewhat
sensitive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is exceedingly kind of him,&rdquo; one elderly
gentleman remarked stiffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is explicit in his conditions,&rdquo; the President
added.</p>

<p>The members were beginning to seem
really awake, and Judge Hobart asked with
some quickness what the conditions were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; the President answered, &ldquo;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
his identity shall not be revealed. I am not
to tell his name, and he trusts to the honor
of any member who may recognize him. A
meeting is to be appointed when and where
we please. He is to know nothing more than
the time. I am to send a carriage for him,
to provide certain things of which he has
given me a list, to arrange a room according
to his directions, and to give him my word
that no record of the meeting shall appear
in the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the things he wishes difficult to procure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the list,&rdquo; said Dr. Taunton, taking
a paper from his pocket. &ldquo;You will see that
they are all sufficiently simple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two rings of iron, four or five inches in
diameter, interlocked and welded firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A ten-inch cube of hard wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A six-inch cube of iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A sealed letter, written by some member.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A carpenter&rsquo;s saw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A gold-fish globe ten inches or so across.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Three smaller globes, one filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
red, one with blue, and one with a colorless
liquid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A scale on which a man may be weighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A stick of sealing-wax.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A flower-pot filled with earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An orange seed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The articles are simple enough,&rdquo; Judge
Hobart commented. &ldquo;Are the arrangements
required difficult?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. He asks for a committee to examine
him in the dressing-room; a platform insulated
with glass and some substance he
will furnish, and a little matter of the arrangement
of lights that is easy enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The members of the Club meditated in
silence for a moment, and then Professor
Gray spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must depend, it seems to me,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;on the sort of a man your mysterious magician
is. If he is a person to be trusted, I
should say go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a gentleman,&rdquo; the President answered;
&ldquo;a man of social standing, money,
education, and with a reputation in his special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
branch of knowledge both here and in
Europe. If I named him, you would, I feel
sure, give him a hearing without question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is his specialty?&rdquo; one member
inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly think it would be fair for me
to tell. It would possibly be too good a clue
to his identity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it fair to ask if it is connected with any
psychical branch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. I think I said at the
start that I never suspected him of any interest
in such subjects. He was asked to join
this Club, and declined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he give any particular reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The President smiled satirically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said it would never accomplish anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that shows his common sense,&rdquo;
Judge Hobart observed dryly. &ldquo;I am bound
to say that it has not accomplished much
thus far. What I do not understand is why
at this late day he takes an interest in our
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He did n&rsquo;t go into that. He did not seem
especially anxious. He merely told me that
he was willing to show the Club certain things,
and named his conditions. That is about the
whole of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Judge Hobart, with his
air of burly frankness, &ldquo;I vote we have him.
The only reason for shying off is that so many
fellows, otherwise sensible, lose their heads
the moment they try to investigate anything
psychical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a reflection on our Club?&rdquo; Professor
Gray asked good-naturedly.</p>

<p>In the end the decision was that the President
should be instructed to make arrangements
with the unknown, and an evening
was chosen for the meeting. The place was
left to the President, to be imparted to the
members confidentially on the day appointed.
Then the gentlemen went their several ways,
each, except the President who knew, speculating
upon the possible identity of the
mysterious wonder-worker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>When the clock struck eight on the evening
appointed, the members of the Club were
all present. The room to which they had been
summoned by Dr. Taunton was simply furnished
with a table, before which the seats were
arranged in a semicircle, and behind which
was a small platform on which stood a single
chair. This platform was raised on blocks
of glass, above which were thin slabs of a
substance which to the eye seemed like a
sort of brown resin, in which were to be discerned
sparkles of yellow, as of minute crystals.
The chair was in turn insulated in the
same manner, while before it for the feet of
the performer was placed a slab of glass covered
with the same resinous substance. On
the chair lay a thick robe of knitted silk.
Beneath the table was a trunk containing the
articles of which the President had read a
list at the previous meeting.</p>

<p>The members examined everything and
handled everything except the platform and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the chair upon it. These they were especially
requested not to touch. At five minutes past
eight a carriage was heard to stop outside, and
almost immediately the President came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman is in the dressing-room,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and is ready for the examining
committee. If the members will be seated,
we shall be prepared to receive him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The members took their seats, and there
was a brief interval of silence. Then Judge
Hobart and Professor Gray, who had gone
to the dressing-room, reëntered. Between
them was a tall man, well formed, rather
slender, but showing in his figure some signs
of approaching middle age. He wore simply
a single garment of knit silk. It was laced in
the back, and fitted him so tightly that the
play of his muscles was as evident as it would
have been in a nude figure. His face was
covered down to the lips by a black mask
of silk.</p>

<p>The unknown stepped out of the loose
slippers he wore, mounted the platform, put
on the silk robe, and sat down in the chair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Judge Hobart made a formal statement that
the perfor&mdash; that their guest had neither
properties nor apparatus concealed about
his person. Then he sat down, and silence
filled the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are ready,&rdquo; President Taunton said.</p>

<p>The stranger smoothed from his lips the
smile which had curled them when Judge
Hobart so nearly spoke of him as the &ldquo;performer.&rdquo;
He rose, and stood on the slab
before his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say a word or two by way of preface,&rdquo;
he began, in a voice cultivated and
pleasant. &ldquo;In the first place, I have no concealed
motive in coming here to-night. I am
not even&mdash;as I shall convince you before we
are done&mdash;gratifying my vanity by advertising
my powers. It has seemed to me that the
Club is not on the right track, and although
in one sense it is none of my business, I am
interested in the subject which it is, as I
understand, the object of this body to investigate.
The paper by Judge Hobart in a recent
number of the &lsquo;Agassiz Quarterly&rsquo; decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
me to show to him that certain forces which
he conclusively proves to be non-existent do,
nevertheless, exist. As I am personally known
to perhaps half the gentlemen in the room,
and am likely to meet some of them not infrequently,
I take the liberty of asking that if
any one shall chance to recognize me, he will
remember that I come on the condition that
my identity remain concealed. The President,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;will bear me out when
I say that I have not seen the things provided
for use this evening, and that I had
no knowledge of the place appointed for the
meeting. The dressing-gown I sent him because
the scantiness of my dress makes it
rather a necessity. I presume that he has
examined it carefully enough to be sure that
it is innocent of witchery and of trickery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and then in a
tone somewhat more determined went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing I must add. I decline to answer
any questions whatever in regard to the means
which produce the effects to which I shall
call your attention. Those from whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
learned would be sufficiently unwilling that I
exhibit my power at all, and were there no
other reason, their wishes would be sufficient
to prevent me from offering information or
explanation. I may not succeed in doing all
that I shall attempt. I have laid out a pretty
serious evening&rsquo;s work, especially for one who
lives as I do amid unfavorable conditions;
and of course I can receive no assistance from
my audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took off the dressing-gown and dropped
it into the chair. Then he removed from his
finger a large seal ring, and laid it between
his feet on the resinous slab.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to show you first,&rdquo; the stranger
said, &ldquo;that if I chose, I could manage to deceive
you into thinking that I accomplished
much that I did not really do. For instance,
I perhaps at this moment look to you like
an elephant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The members of the Psychical Club gasped
in astonishment. Surely upon the platform
stood a large white elephant, twisting his pink
trunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a palm tree,&rdquo; they heard the voice of
the stranger say.</p>

<p>No; not an elephant stood on the platform,
but a tall and graceful date-palm, crowned
with a splendid cluster of spreading fronds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or Dr. Taunton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The members looked in amazement from
the figure of the President sitting in his chair,
twirling his gold eye-glasses with his familiar
gesture, and his double on the platform, as
faithful as a reflection in a mirror, doing the
same thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all this is mere illusion,&rdquo; the voice
went on; &ldquo;I am none of these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more they saw only the silken-clad
figure, tall and supple, smiling under the
black mask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I profess to do,&rdquo; the speaker continued,
&ldquo;I shall really do, and not depend
upon cheating your senses. I shall hope to
leave you proofs and evidences to establish
this completely. The difficulty of the different
expositions of force is not to be judged
by appearances. First, for instance, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
show you an exceedingly simple and easy
thing. It has come to be customary, for some
foolish reason, to speak of these phenomena
as illustrations of the &lsquo;fourth dimension.&rsquo;
The term, I suppose, is as good as another,
since it certainly conveys no definite idea
whatever to people in general. I will ask a
couple of gentlemen to take a pair of interlocked
iron rings that I suppose are among
the articles prepared, and to bring them to
me. I do not wish to leave my insulation,
as in later trials I shall need all my force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rings were taken from the trunk and
brought forward. They were of iron as thick
as a man&rsquo;s thumb, were linked together, and
firmly welded. To pull them apart would
have been impossible for teams of strong
horses. By the direction of the stranger they
were held before him by the two gentlemen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have asked Dr. Taunton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
have the rings privately marked, so as to insure
against any possible suspicion of substitution.
I have never seen them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned forward, and laid his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
lightly on the junction of the rings. They
fell apart instantly. Both were unbroken;
and neither gave the slightest appearance of
strain or rupture. A murmur of surprise
circled the room, and then the members of
the Club broke into hearty applause.</p>

<p>The stranger laughed frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said good-humoredly;
&ldquo;but I am not a juggler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He asked next for the cube of wood and
for the sealed letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen either of these,&rdquo; he
said, the phrase being repeated almost with
a mechanical indifference. &ldquo;I suppose that
the President or the person who wrote the
letter can identify the note wherever he
finds it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At his direction President Taunton held
up before him the cube with the letter lying
upon it. The stranger laid his hand over the
letter, and then showed an empty palm
toward the audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see I have not taken the letter,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;If the saw is there, please cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
block in two in the middle. Cut it across the
grain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the sawing was going on, the magician
put on his wrap and sat down. He resumed
his signet ring, and sat with his head
bowed in his hands. When the block had
been divided, the ends of the letter, cut in
halves, appeared in the midst of the wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; the stranger said, &ldquo;that the
two halves of the note will slip out of the
envelope without difficulty, and Dr. Taunton
will then be able to say whether it is the
original letter or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The president with a little trouble pulled
out the pieces of paper and fitted them together.
He examined them critically, even
using a pocket-glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had not been deceived earlier in the
evening, and if I did not know that it is
wildly impossible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should say
that this is my letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I believe because it is impossible,&rsquo;&rdquo;
quoted the stranger. &ldquo;You may keep the
pieces and decide at your leisure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose as he spoke, and once more threw
off his robe. The Club waited breathless.
He again placed the ring between his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the three globes
filled with colored fluid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were brought to him on a tray, and at
his bidding placed close together in a triangle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is only another of the innumerable
possible variations upon the penetrability
of matter, and would come under the head
in common nomenclature of that stupidly
used term &lsquo;fourth dimension.&rsquo; I said that I
am not a juggler, but of course I chose some
of the tests because they are picturesque,
and so might amuse an audience. See.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laid his hand upon the top of the
three globes. Instantly they became one by
intersection, the three bases being moved
nearer together. Each globe preserved perfectly
its shape, and in the divisions now
made by the coalescing of the section of one
sphere with that of another the liquid was
of the hue resulting from a mingling of the
colors of the differently tinted fluids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>A murmur went around. Several of the
members rose to examine the globes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put them on the table,&rdquo; the wonder-worker
said, &ldquo;and then everybody may see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not to ask questions of methods,&rdquo;
Judge Hobart observed. &ldquo;Is it proper to
inquire whether the experiment involves a
contradiction of the old law that two bodies
cannot occupy the same space?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Modern
science has shown clearly enough that to
seem to occupy space is only to fill it as the
stars fill the sky. I have only taken advantage
of that fact to crowd more matter into
a defined area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The members were asked to seat themselves,
and when this had been done, the
stranger said: &ldquo;Any number of examples of
this power could be given, but these should
be enough, unless some one would prefer to
improvise a test on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad that you say this,&rdquo; Professor
Gray remarked. &ldquo;I am subject to the prejudice,
foolish enough but common, of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
more impressed by experiments of my own
contriving. Do you mind, sir, if Dr. Taunton
and I loop handkerchiefs together, and
let you separate them while we hold the
ends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>The experiment was instantly successful,
and was repeated for double assurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we had nothing else to do,&rdquo; the
stranger observed, &ldquo;we might go on in this
line indefinitely; but this is enough of the
&lsquo;fourth dimension,&rsquo; so called. Now we will
try development.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The flower-pot filled with earth was placed
upon the slab at the feet of the magician.
The orange seed was laid upon the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So ingenious an explanation has recently
been given&mdash;or, more exactly, recently revived&mdash;of
the development of a plant from
a seed, that you may suppose me to have all
the different pieces of an orange grove concealed
about me, despite the fact that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
dress is not adapted to the concealment of a
needle. However, you may judge for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned forward, and with the point of
his finger pushed the seed into the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will some one cover the pot with a handkerchief?&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Please be careful not
to touch me or it. Hold the handkerchief
out, and drop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the members followed the directions,
and for a moment the stranger sat quiet, his
eyes fixed on the covered flower-pot. The
centre of the handkerchief was seen gradually
to rise, and when the cloth was lifted,
the astonished eyes of the Club beheld a
glossy shoot, three or four inches in height.
Without again covering it, the magician
continued to gaze fixedly upon the plant.
Before the eyes of the spectators the shoot
became a shrub, the shrub a tree; the fragrance
of orange blossoms filled the air, and
among the shining leaves began to swell the
golden fruit. The time had been numbered
only in minutes, yet there stood a tree higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
than a man&rsquo;s head, and laden with golden
globes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it away,&rdquo; the wonder-worker said,
&ldquo;and let me rest a little before I try anything
more. You will find the tree to-morrow, and
I think you will concede that it is too bulky
to have been concealed under these fleshings.
If you think it only an optical delusion or
the result of hypnotism, try to-morrow by
the senses of persons who do not know how
it was produced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat for some moments with his head
bowed in his hands. Then at his direction
a globe about a foot in diameter was filled
with clear water and placed on the table. The
lights were then turned down so as to leave
all the room in shadow except the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must ask you to be as quiet as possible,&rdquo;
the magician requested. &ldquo;The experiment
is a difficult one, and from living in the atmosphere
which surrounds my daily life I
am out of the proper condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting his hands behind him, he sank
downward on the slab to his knees, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
reached forward as to press his thumbs upon
his great toes. The position was a singular
one, and earlier in the evening might have
raised a smile. Now all was breathless silence
for a couple of moments. Then the stranger
sprang suddenly to his full height, and directed
his forefinger with a violent movement
toward the globe. A spark of violet light not
unlike that from an electric battery flashed
from the outstretched finger to the globe,
and was seen to remain like a star in the
midst of the water.</p>

<p>From this violet centre, with slow, sinuous
movement, numerous filaments of light grew
out in the liquid, until the globe was filled
with tangled and intertwined threads like
the roots of a hyacinth in its glass. Slowly,
slowly, the nucleus rose to the surface,
dragging the threads behind it. Then above
the water began to form a faint haze. With
gradual motion it mounted, absorbing by
degrees the fire from the phosphorescent
fibres which served for its roots, until a faintly
luminous pillar of dully glowing mist four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
or five feet high showed above the mouth
of the globe.</p>

<p>The magician made strange gestures, and
a slow rotary motion was discerned in the
cloud. Without abrupt or definitely marked
alteration the pillar was modified in shape
until more and more plainly was evident a
resemblance to the human form. He rose to
his full height, and extended both his hands
toward the figure. Slowly it detached itself
from the water and from the globe, and floated
in the air, the perfect shape of a woman,
transparent, faintly luminous, but with a
lustre less cold than at first. One of the men
drew in his breath with a deep and audible
inspiration. The shape wavered, and another
spectator impulsively cried &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
The word seemed to break the spell. The
wonderful visionary form trembled, shivered,
and its exquisite beauty melted in the air.</p>

<p>The magician resumed his seat with visible
disappointment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am already
tired, and you distracted my attention. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
experiment has failed. May the lights be
turned up, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur of disappointment ran around
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I should have
impressed on you more strongly the need of
absolute quiet. I am not quite up to beginning
this over again. Let me show you the
opposite&mdash;disintegration. It is easier to
tear down than to build up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The block of iron he had asked for was
by his direction laid on the floor in front of
the platform. The magician sat for a moment
with closed eyes, his hands laid palm to palm
upon his knees. Then with an abrupt movement
he pointed his two forefingers, pressed
together, toward the cube. A report like that
of a pistol startled the members, and the solid
iron shivered into almost impalpable dust.
The members of the Club crowded together
to the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please do not touch my platform,&rdquo; he
requested, as he had earlier in the evening.
&ldquo;I must still show you something more.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Levitation is a phenomenon which is common
enough,&rdquo; he said by way of preface, &ldquo;but
our examination would by no means be complete
without it. Of course I am only touching
upon a few of the less subtle principles
that underlie what is commonly misnamed
occultism; but this is one of the obvious ones.
Please let some heavy man step upon the
scales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judge Hobart was with some laughter
persuaded to take his place upon the platform
of the scales, and the indicator marked
a weight of two hundred and six pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you look again?&rdquo; the stranger asked
of the gentleman who had read the number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he weighs nothing!&rdquo; the weigher
exclaimed, in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His weight has broken the scales,&rdquo; another
member declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may think,&rdquo; the magician went on,
&ldquo;that I have bewitched the spring. Will
somebody lift the Judge?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Gray, who happened to stand
nearest, put out one hand and picked the
venerable Judge up as easily as he would
have lifted a pocket-handkerchief. As he
took his victim by the collar, the effect did
not tend toward solemnity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; demanded the
Judge. &ldquo;Put me down, sir, at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger made a little sign with his
hand. The Professor saw and understood,
so instead of putting Judge Hobart down,
he lightly tossed the rotund figure upward.
The Judge, probably more to his amazement
than to his satisfaction, found himself floating
in the air with his head against the ceiling,
and with his legs paddling hopelessly
as if he were learning to swim. The other
members shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; the magician said. &ldquo;I did
not mean to turn things into a farce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ponderous form of Judge Hobart
floated softly to the floor; his face showed a
wonderful mixture of bewilderment, wounded
vanity, and relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very warm at the top of the room,&rdquo;
he said, wiping his red forehead; &ldquo;very
warm. Heat rises so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Other things rise also at times,&rdquo; somebody
said.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, and then the members
settled into quiet again, and listened to the
magician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Examples of this sort are infinite in number,
but one is as good as many. The principle
is everywhere the same. Levitation is
really too simple a matter to occupy more of
our time. The transporting of matter through
space and through other matter is more interesting
and more important. It is also more
difficult, and consequently less common.
Some time ago it was proposed in London,
as a test of the reality of occultism, that a
copy of an Indian paper of any given date
be produced in London on the day of its publication
in Calcutta. The test was shirked
by those who are advertising themselves by
pretending to powers which they did not have,
and those who were able to do the feat had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
no interest in helping to bolster up a sham.
That the thing was easily possible is the last
fact with which I shall trouble you to-night.
Allow me to offer you a copy of the &lsquo;London
Times&rsquo; of this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke, a newspaper fluttered from
the air above, and fell upon the table. The
stranger checked a movement which Judge
Hobart made to examine it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me seal it first,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will
make future identification surer. Please lay
it with that stick of sealing-wax on the platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When this had been done, he took the wax
and held it above the paper. The wax melted
without visible cause, and dropped on the
margin of the journal. Leaning forward, the
magician pressed his seal into the red mass,
and then flung the paper again on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be easy,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;to compare
this with a copy received through the
ordinary channels. You do not need to be
instructed in the means proper for securing
and identifying this. The experiment may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
seem to you a simple one, but I assure you
that it is so difficult that you cannot hope to
repeat it without preparation you would find
pretty severe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose as he spoke, and drew his robe
about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to thank you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for
your patience and attention. As I meet so
many of you not infrequently, it is better to
trust to your courtesy not to name me than
to your ignorance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pulled off, as he spoke, the black mask,
and with cries of surprise more than half the
members of the Club called out the name of
one of the best-known club men of the town,
a man who had traveled extensively in the
East, a man who had proved his powers by
distinguished services in literature, a man of
wealth and of leisure, and one of dominating
character. Smiling calmly, he replaced the
mask, and stood a moment in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Then, with a peculiar gesture he waved
his arms over the company, and repeated a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
few words in some unknown tongue. He
stepped down from the platform and walked
quietly from the room. But by that gesture
or spell he had strangely wrought upon their
minds; from that moment no man of them
all, not even the President, has ever been able
to remember who was their acquaintance
who that evening did such wonders in the
sight of the astonished Psychical Club.</p>

<h2>TIM CALLIGAN&rsquo;S GRAVE-MONEY</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T was a fool&rsquo;s notion to get tipped out
of a boat anywhere,&rdquo; said Tim Calligan to
his circle of fellow pensioners at the Dartbank
poor-farm, &ldquo;me that&rsquo;s been on the
water like a bubble from the day me mother
weaned me, saints rest her soul, and she as
decent a woman as ever was born in County
Cork.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tim was relating the oft-told tale of his
escape from drowning, a story of which they
were fond, and which he delighted to tell.
The old man had a fertile Celtic fancy, and
his narrations were luxuriant with exuberant
growth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there was meself drownin&rsquo; like a blind
kitten in a pond,&mdash;and many &rsquo;s the litter
of &rsquo;em I&rsquo;d sent to the cat&rsquo;s Purgatory by the
way of that very river, saving that the Purgatory
of cats there ain&rsquo;t any, having no souls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
by the token that having nine lives they&rsquo;d
belike have nine souls, and being so many
they&rsquo;d crowd good Christian souls in Paradise,&mdash;blessings
on the holy saints for previnting
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more could I make me head stay out
of water,&rdquo; Tim went on, &ldquo;than if it was a
stone. &lsquo;Good-by, Tim, me boy,&rsquo; sez I to meself.
&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re gone this time,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll
miss nothing in not being at yer wake, by the
token that there won&rsquo;t be no wake; and ef
there was,&rsquo; sez I, still to meself, &lsquo;there could
be nothing to drink but water here in this
cursed stream.&rsquo; And down I went again,
like a dasher in a churn. &lsquo;Holy St. Bridget,&rsquo;
thinks I, &lsquo;how far &rsquo;ll it be to the bottom of
this ondecent river. Likely it goes clean
through to Chiny,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;and one of them
bloody, onbelaving heathen &rsquo;ll be grabbing
me presently with his mice-eating hands.
But it&rsquo;s better being pulled out by a heretic
heathen than staying in and soaking.&rsquo; With
that up again I goes, like a shellaly at a fair;
and it was like fire flashing in me eyes. Sez I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to meself: &lsquo;That &rsquo;ll be Widdy Malony&rsquo;s bit of
a house,&rsquo; sez I, spaking always in me mind
because of the floods of water in me mouth.
&lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be burning to the very ground,&rsquo; sez I,
&lsquo;and me missing all the fun of it. The blessed
saints help the poor woman, turned out of
house and home to get bite and sup for her
children like a chipmunk, and every one of
them taking after Dennis, and I might have
married her meself long ago if they was fewer,
for I&rsquo;d want a ready-made family small,&rsquo; sez
I to meself, plunking up and down in the
water like a dumpling in the broth. &lsquo;&rsquo;T is
pitiful to think of her house burning down
over her head,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;and she never to know
the man might have made her Mis&rsquo; Calligan&rsquo;s
down here drowning in plain sight of the
very flames of it, and she nor nobody doing
one thing to save him, praise be to the handiworks
of God. Faith, and &rsquo;t would be better
for the both of us if she had more water and
meself more fire,&rsquo; sez I in me mind. And all
the time &rsquo;t was no fire, but just the blessed
sun I&rsquo;d never see again, barring I had n&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
got saved, and it shining and flashing in the
eyes of me from the widdy&rsquo;s windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tale was long, for it included an enumeration
of all the sensations and emotions
which Tim had really experienced, and all
those which, in the course of long years, he
had been able to imagine he might have felt.
As at the poor-farm time was not an object,
however, except of slaughter, the length of the
narrative was its greatest recommendation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with that,&rdquo; Tim at last ended his
recital, &ldquo;I felt the whole top of me head
pulled off as I lay soft and easy on the bottom
of the flood, and thinking nothing at all,
but reflecting how soft the mud of it were and
pitying Pat Donovan that he&rsquo;d never get
the quarter I owed him. &lsquo;That &rsquo;ll be a Chany-man
or the Divil, Tim, me boy,&rsquo; sez I to
meself; and then I made no more observes to
meself at all, owing to the soul having gone
out of me body. And all the time it was Bill
Trafton catching me by the hair, him having
dove for me just shortly after me being dead,
and dragging me to the top when I could n&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
be moved from the bottom, and was likely
to die any minute, saving that it was dead
already I was. And he saved me life, by the
token that the soul had gone out of me peaceful;
but, Holy Mother, how&rsquo;ll I be telling ye
the pain of its coming back! &rsquo;T was like the
unwilling dragging back of a pig out of a
praitie patch to get the soul of me back from
the place it had gone to, and they rubbing
me to show it the care they&rsquo;d take of me, and
coaxing it for two mortal hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the tale ended, the bleared eyes of one
of the auditors were attracted to a light wagon
which had turned into the lane at the foot
of the long slope upon which the poor-house
stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody &rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; old Simeon observed
deliberately. &ldquo;Likely it&rsquo;s the new
Over<em>seer</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; Tim assented. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
Dan Springer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;spected he was a-comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Grandsire
Welsh commented, with a senile chuckle.
&ldquo;Huldy and Sam&rsquo;s been a-slickin&rsquo; up things.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Huldy and Sam,&rdquo; in more official language
Mr. and Mrs. Dooling, were the not
unworthy couple who had the poor-farm in
charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you sayin&rsquo; t&rsquo;other day,&rdquo; asked
old Simeon, &ldquo;thet you particular wantid to
see the Over<em>seer</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pining for him I am the time,&rdquo; Tim
answered.</p>

<p>The old men sat silent, watching the approach
of the visitor, who drove up to the
hitching-post near them, and who leaped
from his wagon with a briskness almost
startling to the aged chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spry,&rdquo; old Simeon commented. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen the time, though, when I was spry too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Springer fastened his horse, and came
toward them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo; do, boys?&rdquo; he said cheerily.
&ldquo;How goes it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contrast between his great hearty
voice and the thin quavers in which they
answered him was pathetic. He lingered a
moment, and then turned to make his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
into the house. Tim rose and hobbled rheumatically
after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whist, Mister Springer,&rdquo; he called;
&ldquo;would ye be after waiting a wee bit till I
have a word of speech with yer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what can I do for you?&rdquo; Springer
asked good-naturedly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they treat you
well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man took him by the arm and
drew him around the corner of the house,
away from the curious eyes of his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whist!&rdquo; he said, with a strange and
sudden air of excitement. &ldquo;Wait till I&rsquo;m
after telling yer. Your honor&rsquo;ll mind I&rsquo;m
after <em>trusting</em> yer; <em>trusting</em> yer, and ye&rsquo;ll no
be betraying an old man. It&rsquo;s meself,&rdquo; he
added, with a touch of pride at once whimsical
and pathetic, &ldquo;is ninety-three the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you as old as that? Well, I&rsquo;d keep
your secret if you were twice as old,&rdquo; Springer
returned, with clumsy but kindly jocoseness.</p>

<p>Tim raised himself until he stood almost
upright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the money,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;the
money I&rsquo;ve saved for me burying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to stretch his thin, bloodless
finger toward the bleak cluster of mounds
on the hillside where mouldered the dead of
the poor-farm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll no lie there,&rdquo; he said, with husky intensity.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve scraped and scraped, and
saved and saved, and it&rsquo;s the wee bit money
I&rsquo;ve got to pay for a spot of consecrated
ground over to Tiverton. Ye&rsquo;ll no put me
here when I&rsquo;m gone! I&rsquo;ll no rest here! Me
folks was respectable in the Old Isle, an&rsquo;
not unbeknowing the gentry; and there&rsquo;s
never a one put outside consecrated ground.
Ye&rsquo;ll promise me I&rsquo;ll be put in the graveyard
over to Tiverton, and me got the money to
pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Springer was as unemotional and unimaginative
as a hearty, practical, well-fed man
could be, but seeing the tears in the old
pauper&rsquo;s bleared eyes, and hearing the passion
of his tone, he could not but be moved.
He had heard something of this before. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
predecessor in office had mentioned Tim,
and his twenty years&rsquo; saving, but so few
were the chances a pauper in Dartbank had
of picking up even a penny that the hoard
even of so long a time could not be large.
Now and then some charitable soul had
given the old man a trifle. A vague sympathy
was felt for the pathetic longing to be assured
of a grave in consecrated ground, even among
the villagers who regarded the idea itself as
rank superstition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Tim,&rdquo; the Overseer said.
&ldquo;If you go off while I have the say, I&rsquo;ll see
to it myself. If you&rsquo;d be any more comfortable
over in Tiverton, we&rsquo;ll plant you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank yer honor kindly,&rdquo; Tim answered.
&ldquo;The Calligans has always been decent, God-fearing
folks, and it&rsquo;s meself&rsquo;d be loth to
disgrace the name a-crawling up out of this
unholy graveyard forby on Judgment Day,
and all the world there to see, and I never
could do it so sly but the O&rsquo;Tools and the
O&rsquo;Hooligans &rsquo;d spy on me, and they always
so mad with envy of the Calligans they&rsquo;d be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
after tattling the news all over Heaven, and
bringing shame to me whole kith and kin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Overseer laughed, and responded that
if Tim had laid by the money to pay for the
job, he would certainly see that the grave was
made in the consecrated earth of Tiverton
churchyard. Then with a brisk step he passed
on to attend to the sordid affairs of his office
within. The most troublesome matter was
left until the last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the Trafton child,&rdquo; he said to Huldy
and Sam, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that anything can be
done. I&rsquo;ve spoken to the Selectmen about
it, and they don&rsquo;t think the town should be
called on to pay out twenty-five dollars when
here&rsquo;s a place for the child for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I told Louizy,&rdquo; Huldy
responded. &ldquo;I said that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d say;
but Louizy &rsquo;s dretful cut up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Springer moved uneasily or impatiently in
his seat, so that the old wooden chair creaked
under the weight of his substantial person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know she is,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if I could afford
it, I&rsquo;d send the child to her folks myself; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
I can&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t see but the girl&rsquo;s got to
go to &rsquo;Lizy Ann Betts. Perhaps she won&rsquo;t
be so hard on her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard on her,&rdquo; sniffed Huldy; &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll
just kill her; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the word a wretched-looking woman
pushed into the kitchen as if she had been
listening at the door. She held out before
her a right hand withered and shriveled by
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Springer,&rdquo; she broke out, tears
running down her cheeks, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t send my
Nellie to be bound to that woman! She&rsquo;s all
I&rsquo;ve got in the world; and she never wanted
till I was burned. Send her to my folks in Connecticut
and they&rsquo;ll treat her as their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sank down suddenly as if her strength
failed, and sat stiff and despairing, with eyes
of wild entreaty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard, I know,&rdquo; Springer answered
awkwardly, &ldquo;but Nellie&rsquo;ll be near you, and
she would n&rsquo;t be in Connecticut. &rsquo;Lizy Ann
Betts ain&rsquo;t a bad-hearted woman. She&rsquo;ll
do well by the child, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do well?&rdquo; the mother cried shrilly,
raising herself with sudden vehemence. &ldquo;Did
she do well by the last girl was bound to her
from this farm? Did n&rsquo;t she kill her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, Louizy,&rdquo; interposed Huldy,
&ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t no sort of use to make a fuss. What
the S&rsquo;lectmen say they say, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was interrupted by a cry without, and
in an instant the door was flung open by old
Simeon, who with wildly waving arms and
weirdly working face cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;F&rsquo; th&rsquo; Lord&rsquo;s sake! Come quicker &rsquo;n
scat! Old Tim&rsquo;s in a fit!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The account old Simeon and Grandsire
Welsh gave of Tim&rsquo;s seizure was that he had
been sitting outside the kitchen window,
where they all were listening with interest to
the conversation within, when suddenly he
had thrown up his arms, crying out that he
could not do it, and had fallen in a fit. No
one at the poor-farm could know that Tim
had reached the crisis of a severe mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
struggle which had been going on for days.
He had for days listened to the bitter words
of Mrs. Trafton, and had sympathized with
her grief over her child; and all the time he
listened he had been secretly conscious that
the little hoard he had gathered for his burying
would save Nellie from the Betts woman,
a shrew notorious all over the county for her
cruelty. He remembered that Bill Trafton
had saved him from drowning; that Mrs.
Betts had the credit of having caused the
death of her last bound child; and against
this he set the terror of rising at the Resurrection
from the unblessed precincts of the
Dartbank Potter&rsquo;s Field. The mental conflict
had been too much for him, and the
appeal of Mrs. Trafton to the Overseer had
broken old Tim down.</p>

<p>Tim was got to bed, and in time recovered
his senses, although he was very weak. Mrs.
Trafton volunteered to watch with him that
night, and so it came about that at midnight
she sat in the bare chamber where old
Tim lay. As the hours wore on Tim seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
much brighter, and asked her to talk to him
to while away the time. The only subject
in her mind was her child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Nellie was with my folks,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d try to stand being away from her; but
it&rsquo;s just killing me to have that Betts woman
starve her and beat her the way she&rsquo;s done
with the others. She&rsquo;d kill Nellie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tim moved uneasily in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But ye&rsquo;d be after seein&rsquo; the child here,&rdquo;
he muttered feebly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d see her no more&rsquo;n if she was with my
folks,&rdquo; returned Louizy bitterly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d
know how she was suffering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sick man did not answer. He turned
his face to the wall and lay silent. After a
time his regular breathing showed that he
slept, while the watcher brooded in hopeless
grief. At length Tim grew restless and began
to mutter in his sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor creature&rsquo;s having a bad dream,&rdquo;
Louizy said to herself, as his words grew more
vehement and wild. &ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;d better
wake him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>She was still debating the matter in her
mind when Tim gave a sudden cry and sat
up in bed, trembling in every limb. His face
was ghastly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will, I will!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;I will,
so help me Holy Mary!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tim, Tim, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the
nurse.</p>

<p>The old man clutched her hands desperately
for a moment, and then seemed to
recover a little his reason. He sank down
again and closed his eyes. For a time he
lay there silent. Then he said with strange
solemnity:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T is a vision meself has had this night,
Louizy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought his mind still wandering, but
in a moment he went on with more calmness:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell it to ye all, Louizy. Give me a sup
till I get strength. I&rsquo;m no more strong than
a blind kitten that&rsquo;s just born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him nourishment and stimulant,
and Tim feebly and with many pauses told
his dream. The force of a natural dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
narrator still shaped his speech, and as he
became excited, he spoke with more and more
strength, until he was sitting up in bed, and
speaking with a voice more clear than he
had used for many a day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was a fearsome dream&rsquo;s had holt
on me the night. &rsquo;T is meself&rsquo;s been palarvering
with the blessed St. Peter face to face
and tongue to tongue; and if I&rsquo;d ought to
be some used to it through having been dead
once already by drowning, this time I was
broke up by being dead in good earnest, by
the same token that when St. Peter set his
two piercing black eyes on me, I could tell by
the look of &rsquo;em that it was straight through
me whole body he was seeing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the first thing I knew in my dream
I was going all sole alone on a frightsome
road all sprinkled over with ashes and bones,
and I that crawly in my back I could feel the
backbone of me wiggling up and down like
a caterpillar, so my heart was choking in my
throat with the fear of it. And I went on and
I went on; and all the time it was in the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of me there was that coming behind was more
fearsome than all the bones and skelingtons
forninst. And I went on and I went on,
seeming to be pushed along like, and not
able to help meself; and all the time something
was creeping, and creeping, and creeping
behind, till all the blood in my body was
that chilled the teeth of me chattered. And
I went on and I went on till I could n&rsquo;t stand
it one mortal minute more; but I had to turn
if the life went out of me for it. And there
behind was a mite of a girl, a wee bit thing,
thin and starved looking, and seeming that
weak it was pitiful to see. &lsquo;Poor thing,&rsquo; sez
I to my own ghost, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s pitying her the day
is Tim Calligan, if I be him,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;and not
some other body, for having no body perhaps
I ain&rsquo;t anybody at all, but just a spook
in this place that ain&rsquo;t nowhere.&rsquo; And all the
time I was that scared of the wee bit child,
being as it were where it could n&rsquo;t be, and me
dead before it and it dead behind me, and
always following and following; so without
thinking deeply what was to be done, I starts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
up and runs as hard as my legs that was
turned into ghost shanks would let me. And
I run through them ashes, stumbling on bones
and seeing shadows that would get in the
way and I had to run through &rsquo;em, and the
weight of the horror of it words would n&rsquo;t
tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when I run, the wee bit child run;
and it scared me worse than ever when the
further I run away from it the closer it was
to me, till at last it had a grab on the tail of
my coat; and it clung on, and I that mad
with fear I had no more sense than a hen with
its head cut off and goes throwing itself round
about for anger at the thought of being killed,
and not knowing it is dead already. And oh,
Louizy, the scaresomeness of the places I
run through a-trying to get rid of that wee
bit thing! It&rsquo;s downright awful to think of
the things that can happen to a dead man
while he&rsquo;s alive all the time and forgetful of
it through dreaming!</p>

<p>&ldquo;So when I&rsquo;d been going on till mortal
man could n&rsquo;t stand it no longer, let alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a ghost, there I was just forninst the gate of
Heaven, not in the least knowing how I
come there or would I get in; and blessed St.
Peter himself on a white stone outside the
gate sitting and smiling and looking friendly
so the terror went out of me like a shadow in
the sun. And I scraped my foot, and I went
up close to him, standing that way would
I hide the child ahind of me; for sez I to
meself: &lsquo;What&rsquo;ll I say to his Reverence and
he axes me about the girl?&rsquo; And St. Peter he
sez to me, mighty polite and condescending:
&lsquo;Good-morning,&rsquo; sez he. &lsquo;The top of the
morning to your Reverence, and thank ye
kindly,&rsquo; sez I. &lsquo;And what&rsquo;ll be your name?&rsquo;
sez he. &lsquo;Tim Calligan, your honor,&rsquo; sez I,
answering as pert as ever I could; for there
was that in his manner of speaking that
made me feel shivery, as if me heart&rsquo;d been
out all night in a snowstorm. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a decent,
respectable body I am, your Reverence,&rsquo;
sez I, &lsquo;though I say it as should n&rsquo;t, having
nobody else at hand that would put in a
word for me.&rsquo; &lsquo;And was ye buried in holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
ground?&rsquo; sez he. &lsquo;I was that,&rsquo; sez I; &lsquo;and
many&rsquo;s the weary year I&rsquo;ve been scraping
to do that,&rsquo; sez I. &lsquo;And what&rsquo;ll that be
behind ye?&rsquo; sez he. And I looked this way
and that way, trying to make as if I did n&rsquo;t
know; and at last I pretended to spy the
child, and to be that surprised he could n&rsquo;t
suspect I ever clapped eyes on the wee bit
thing before. &lsquo;That, your Reverence,&rsquo; sez I,
&lsquo;has the look of a scrap of a girl. Is it one
your Reverence is bringing up?&rsquo; sez I, being
that desperate I was as bold as a brass kettle.
&lsquo;And what&rsquo;ll she be doing here?&rsquo; sez his
Reverence, paying no heed to the impertinence
of the question. &lsquo;Sure, how&rsquo;ll I know
that?&rsquo; sez I. &lsquo;Will she be coming with you?&rsquo;
sez he. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t she belong hereabouts?&rsquo; sez I,
trying hard to brazen it out, and feeling my
heart go plump down out of my mouth into
my boots, more by token that I was barefoot
the time. &lsquo;Will she be coming with you?&rsquo;
sez he again. &lsquo;Sorra a bit,&rsquo; sez I; &lsquo;I just
could n&rsquo;t get away from her,&rsquo; sez I. &lsquo;And
what for&rsquo;ll you be trying to get away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
her, and her no bigger than a bee&rsquo;s knee?&rsquo;
sez he, looking at me so hard that I could n&rsquo;t
hold up my face forninst him. &lsquo;Well, your
Reverence,&rsquo; sez I, looking down at the stones,
and seeing the weeds trying to grow between
them in the very face of Heaven itself, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
inconvenient traveling with a child anywhere,
let alone the ondecent places I&rsquo;ve
been through this night; and the girl was n&rsquo;t
mine, and I might get blamed for keeping
her out late, with her folks getting scared
about her, not knowing where she was, and
not understanding she was where your Holiness
would be after caring for her.&rsquo; And with
that St. Peter put out his hand, looking that
sharp his eyes went through me like needles;
and he pulled the wee bit child from behind
me, and he sez to her: &lsquo;What is the name of
yer?&rsquo; &lsquo;Nellie,&rsquo; sez she, her voice so thin you
could n&rsquo;t hear it, only knowing what she said
from the moving of her lips like shadows on
the wall. &lsquo;And how came you here?&rsquo; sez he.
&lsquo;I was beat and starved to death,&rsquo; sez she,
shivering till &rsquo;t was a mercy she did n&rsquo;t go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
pieces like a puff of smoke. And with that
St. Peter looked at me once more, and the
cold sweat run down my backbone like rain
down a conductor in a thunder-storm. &lsquo;Your
Reverence,&rsquo; sez I, trembling, &lsquo;I did n&rsquo;t beat
and starve the girl.&rsquo; &lsquo;That may be,&rsquo; sez he,
&lsquo;but there&rsquo;ll be some reason why she&rsquo;s hanging
on to your coat-tail like a burr on a dog,&rsquo;
sez he. &lsquo;What for are you following Tim
Calligan,&rsquo; sez he to the girl, &lsquo;and he dead
and resting in holy ground?&rsquo; And with that
she put you her little front finger, that was
as thin as a sparrow&rsquo;s claw that&rsquo;s starved to
death in winter, and she pointed to me, and
sez she: &lsquo;He would n&rsquo;t give the money to
send me to my folks,&rsquo; sez she; &lsquo;and my own
father saved the life of him when he was dead
and drownded before I was born,&rsquo; sez she.
&lsquo;What for would n&rsquo;t you give the money,
Tim?&rsquo; sez St. Peter, sitting there on that
white stone like a judge trying the life of a
man. &lsquo;Your Reverence,&rsquo; sez I, falling down
on the stones at the feet of him, &lsquo;twenty
years was I struggling, and saving, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
scraping to get the bit money for a grave in
holy ground! If I&rsquo;d give it to the child, I&rsquo;d
be down this blessed minute I&rsquo;m having the
honor of conversing with your Holiness&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s proud I am of your condescending
so far!&mdash;lying in unconsecrated ground all
cheek by jowl with heretics, and like as not
getting my bones mixed with theirs at the
blessed resurrection. Sorra a bit did I know
the suffering of this poor wee bit thing.&rsquo; &lsquo;And
did her father save your life?&rsquo; sez he. &lsquo;He
did that,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;and a good, decent, God-fearing
man he were,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;barring he were
a heretic, your Reverence, owing to his not
being asked, it&rsquo;s likely, would he be born a
good Catholic,&mdash;and I hope your Reverence
ain&rsquo;t been too hard on Bill Trafton if he&rsquo;s
come this way,&rsquo; sez I. &lsquo;Tim,&rsquo; sez St. Peter,
looking at me with a look like one of the long
isuckles on the north side of the barn in January,&mdash;&lsquo;Tim,
&rsquo;t is no use trying the palarver
on me,&rsquo; sez he. &lsquo;Ye know ye let this child get
bound to that Betts woman, and now she&rsquo;ll
be bate to death, and who&rsquo;s to bear the blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
if not ye that might have stopped it? Do
ye think, Tim Calligan,&rsquo; sez he, raising his
voice so the blessed angels come a-looking
over the holy walls of Heaven to see what
would be the matter,&mdash;by the same token
that the little gold hoops floating round their
heads kept clashing together and sounding
like sleigh-bells, their heads was that close
together on top of the wall, and all their eyes
looking at me that sorrowful like it nigh
broke my heart,&mdash;&lsquo;do ye think,&rsquo; sez he,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;re sleeping in holy ground when the
price of the grave your worthless old carcass
is in was the life of this wee bit child?&rsquo; And
all the angels shook their heads, and looked
at me that reproachful the heart in me got
so big it would have killed me with its swelling
only saving that I was dead already, not
to say being dead twice; and I fell to sobbing
and praying to St. Peter for mercy,&mdash;and
the first thing I knew I woke up in bed, praise
be to the handiworks of God! made alive
again, this being the third time, counting the
time I was first born.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Tim&rsquo;s tale was long, and it was interrupted
by frequent intervals of rest made necessary
by his weakness. When he ended, the pale
forecast of dawn shone into the squalid room.
Louizy was crying softly, in the suppressed
fashion of folk unaccustomed to give full vent
even to grief. Tim lay quiet for a long time.
At last he aroused himself to feel beneath
the mattress, and to bring to light a dirty
bag of denim. This he pressed into the hand
of his nurse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take you both,&rdquo; he murmured feebly.
&ldquo;Blessings go with ye, and the saints be good
to the soul of Tim Calligan, coming up at the
Day of Judgment like a scared woodchuck
out of unblessed ground!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Tim failed rapidly. The excitement of his
dream and the moral struggle through which
he had passed had worn upon his enfeebled
powers. On the second day after his seizure
the priest came from Tiverton to administer
the last rites. When this was over, Tim lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
quiet, hardly seeming alive. Thus he was
when Springer, who drove over late in the
afternoon, came in to see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tim,&rdquo; Springer said, &ldquo;Mrs. Dooling has
told me what you have done. The ground
you lie in will make little difference to a man
that would do a thing so white as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly,&rdquo; Tim answered, in
the shadow of a voice. &ldquo;Father O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s
promised to bless my grave. It&rsquo;s not the same
as being at Tiverton where the ground would
be soaked with the blessing all round, but
leastways St. Peter &rsquo;ll not be after flinging
it in my face that the blood of the child&rsquo;s
on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Overseer regarded him with such
tenderness as did not often shine within the
doors of the poor-farm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tim,&rdquo; he said, leaning forward as if he
were half ashamed of his good impulse,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry any more. I&rsquo;ll pay for your
grave at Tiverton, and see that you are put
in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old pauper turned upon him a glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of positive rapture. He clasped his thin,
withered hands, trembling like rushes in the
winds of autumn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holy and Blessed Virgin,&rdquo; he prayed,
almost with a sob, &ldquo;be good to him for giving
a poor old dying creature the wish of his
heart! Blessed St. Peter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the rush of joy was too great. With a
face of ecstasy the old man died.</p>

<h2>MISS GAYLORD AND JENNY</h2>


<p>When Alice Gaylord was, by the death of her
grandmother, set free from the long servitude
of attending upon the invalid, it might
have seemed that nothing need hinder the
fulfilling of her protracted engagement to Dr.
Carroll. The friends of both the young people
expressed, in decorous fashion, their satisfaction
that old Mrs. Gaylord, ninety and bed-ridden,
should at last have been released,
and it was entirely well understood that what
they meant was to signify their pleasure at
the ending of Alice&rsquo;s tedious waiting. Some
doubt in regard to the girl&rsquo;s health, however,
still clouded the prospect. Long care and
confinement had told on her; and when a
decent interval had passed after the death,
and the wedding did not take place, people
began to say that it was such a pity that
Alice was not well enough to be married.</p>

<p>Dr. Carroll was thinking of her health as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
one gloomy November afternoon, he walked
down West Cedar Street to the house where
Gaylords had dwelt from the time when West
Cedar Street began its decorous existence,
and where Alice declared she had herself
lived for generations. He glanced up at the
narrow strip of sky like dull flannel overhead,
around at the dwellings like a row of proper
spinsters ranged on either side of the way,
and at the Gaylord house itself, a brick and
glass epitome of old Boston respectability.
He reflected impatiently that of course Alice
could be no better until he got her out of an
atmosphere so depressing. Then he remembered
that he had always liked West Cedar
Street, and he began to wonder whether he
were not getting so morbid over Alice that
some other physician should be called in.</p>

<p>He had long been baffled by being unable
to discover anything wrong, beyond the fact
that the girl was worn out with the strain of
ministering to an imperious and exacting invalid.
She was nervously exhausted; and he
said to himself for the hundredth time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
rest was the only thing needed. A few months
would set everything right. The difficulty
was that time had thus far not come up to
what was expected of it. Carroll was forced
to acknowledge that, in spite of tonics and
rest, Alice was really not much better, and he
had come almost to feel that the real cause
of her languor and weakness was involved
in teasing mystery.</p>

<p>The prim white door, with its fan-light
overhead and the discreetly veiled side-windows
fantastically leaded, was opened
by Abby, a sort of housekeeper, who had
the air of being coeval with the house, if
not with Boston itself. George always smiled
inwardly at the look with which he was
received by this primeval damsel, a look of
virginal primness at the idea of allowing in
the house a man who was professedly a suitor,
and he declared to Alice that he was still,
after long experience, a little afraid of Abby&rsquo;s
regard. To-day her customary look vanished
quickly, to give place to one more vivid and
spontaneous. Abby put up a lean finger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
mysteriously enjoining silence, and spoke
instantly in a sibilant whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please come in here, sir, before
you go upstairs?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She waved her thin hand toward the little
reception-room, and the doctor, in mild wonderment,
obeyed the gesture and entered.
Abby closed the door softly, and came toward
him with an air of concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell you, sir,&rdquo; the old servant said
in a half voice, &ldquo;a queer thing&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A queer thing&rsquo;s come,&rdquo; he repeated, leaning
against the mantel. &ldquo;Come from where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come, sir,&rdquo; repeated Abby, a certain
relish of her mystery seeming to his ear to
impart an unctuous flavor to her tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just come. Nobody knows where things come
from, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean something&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; that&rsquo;s what I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir; but it&rsquo;s queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her wrinkled old face, where
now the mouth was drawn in as if she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
pulled up her lips with puckering-strings lest
some secret escape. He smiled at her important
manner, and, leaning his elbow on the
mantel, prepared for the slow process of
getting at what the woman really meant. It
proved in the event less laborious than usual,
and he reflected that the directness with which
Abby gave her information was sufficient
indication of the seriousness with which she
regarded it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Alice ain&rsquo;t right, sir. She does what
she don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he demanded,
really startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wrote a letter to you last night, and
then instead of mailing it she cut it all up
into teenty tonty pieces, postage stamp and
all; and then said she did n&rsquo;t know who
did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carroll stared at the woman. Whimsies
and mysteries were alike so foreign to Alice
that his first and natural thought was that
Abby had lost her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, sir, every word,&rdquo; Abby insisted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
answering his unspoken incredulity. &ldquo;She
did just &rsquo;s I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she said she did n&rsquo;t know who did it,&rdquo; the
young man said sharply, &ldquo;she did n&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she did n&rsquo;t know. That &rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s queer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she could n&rsquo;t have done it herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I saw her doing it, sir, and I
wondered what was the matter with the letter;
only I did n&rsquo;t notice the postage stamp, or
I&rsquo;d have spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carroll knew that Abby was as well aware
as was he of Alice&rsquo;s invincible truthfulness,
and that he had not to reckon with any
unfounded suspicion of deceit. If Alice had
said she did not know who destroyed the
letter, then it was evident that she had done
it unconsciously and in some condition which
needed to be inquired into. He leaned back
against the mantel, and playing absently with
the dangling prisms which hung above a
brazen pair of pastoral lovers on the old-fashioned
candelabra, he heard Abby&rsquo;s story
in full. Miss Gaylord had said to the servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
that she was about to write the letter, and
that it must be posted that evening. Going
to the parlor after the note, Abby had seen
her mistress cut it to pieces. The maid withdrew,
supposing that for some reason the
note needed rewriting; but on returning some
time later, she had been met by the declaration
that it was on the table. As it was not there,
her mistress had joined in searching for it,
but nothing could be found save the fragments
in the waste-basket. Miss Gaylord had insisted
that she had not cut it, and that she
was entirely ignorant of how the damage had
occurred.</p>

<p>Dr. Carroll was puzzled and troubled, nor
was he less so when Alice had given him her
account. She did this unsolicited, and with
evident frankness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose, George,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s absent-mindedness;
but if I have got so far that I
don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing, I&rsquo;d better be
shut up for a lunatic at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has anything of the sort ever happened
before?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; was her answer; &ldquo;but
sometimes I&rsquo;ve found things done that I
could not remember doing: my clothes put
in queer places, and that sort of thing, you
know. I never really thought much about it
before. You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could see that she was seriously troubled,
and he set himself to dissipate her concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are tired, and so you may
be a little absent-minded; but I certainly do
not think it&rsquo;s worth making any fuss about.
You and Abby will have a theory of demoniacal
possession soon, to account for a mere
slip of memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not leave her until it seemed to him
that she no longer regarded the incident seriously;
but in his own mind he was by no
means at ease. At the earliest moment possible
he went to consult with a fellow physician
who was a specialist in disorders of the
nerves, and to him he told the whole case as
accurately as he was able. The specialist put
some questions and in the end asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she ever been hypnotized?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she never has,&rdquo; Carroll answered.
&ldquo;She might easily be a subject, I
should think. She&rsquo;s naturally nervous, and
just now she is run down and unstrung.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems like a case of self-hypnotism,&rdquo;
the other said. &ldquo;Sometimes, you know, patients
unconsciously hypnotize themselves,
or get hypnotized, without having any idea
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would n&rsquo;t she know it afterward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; the second personality generally
knows all about the first&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; interrupted Carroll, &ldquo;that
the normal person is the first and the hypnotized
is the second?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The personality that comes to the
surface in hypnotism, the subliminal self,
knows all about the normal person, but the
normal person has no idea of the existence
of the secondary, the subliminal personality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so cheerful to think of yourself as
a sort of nest of boxes,&rdquo; Carroll commented
grimly, &ldquo;one personality inside of the other,
and you only knowing about the outside box.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Or you <em>being</em> only the outside box, perhaps,&rdquo;
the specialist responded, with a smile.
&ldquo;Well, what we don&rsquo;t know would fill rather
a good-sized book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The suggestion of hypnotism remained in
Carroll&rsquo;s mind, and it was not many days
before he had a sufficiently plain but altogether
disagreeable confirmation of the specialist&rsquo;s
theory. He was with Alice in the old
drawing-room, a place of quaint primness,
with fine, staid Copley portraits, and an air
of self-respecting propriety utterly at variance
with psychical mysteries. He stood gazing
out of the window, while Alice moved about
the room looking for a book of which they
had been speaking, and his eye was caught
by a sparkling point of light on the sunlit
wall of the house opposite. He made some
casual remark in regard to it, and Alice came
to look over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be a grain of sand in the mortar,
I suppose,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It is making a
tremendous effect for such a little thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not answer for an instant. Then
she burst into a laugh which to him sounded
strange and unpleasant, and clapped her
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; she said joyously.</p>

<p>He wheeled quickly toward her. Her face
seemed to have undergone a change, slight
yet extraordinary. She was laughing with a
glee that was not without a suspicion of
malice, and she met his look with a boldness
so different from the usual regard of Alice
as to seem almost brazen. He could see that
his evident bewilderment amused her greatly.
A mischievous twinkle lighted her glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course you think I&rsquo;m she; but
I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m a good deal nicer. She&rsquo;s a tiresome
old thing, anyway. You&rsquo;d like me a
great deal better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carroll was entirely too confused to speak,
but he was a physician, and could not help
reflecting instantly upon the cause of this
strange metamorphosis. He naturally thought
of hypnotism, and he came in a second thought
to realize that Alice had with amazing rapidity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
been sent into a hypnotic condition by
looking for an instant at the glittering point
on the wall of the house across the street.
What the result might be, or what the words
she spoke meant, he could not even conjecture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stare at me so,&rdquo; the girl went on.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jenny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he repeated confusedly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
Jenny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m Jenny, and I&rsquo;m worth six of
that silly Alice you&rsquo;re engaged to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took her lightly by the shoulders and
looked at her, quite as much for the sake
of steadying his own nerves as from any
expectation of learning anything by examination.
Her eyes shone with an unwonted
brightness, and seemed to him to gleam with
an archness of which Alice would not have
been capable. The cheeks were flushed, not
feverishly, but healthily, and the girl had
lost completely the appearance of exhaustion
which had troubled him so long. The head
was carried with a new erectness, and as he
regarded her she tossed it saucily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You may look at me as much as you
like,&rdquo; she said gayly. &ldquo;I can stand it. Don&rsquo;t
you think I am better looking than she is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was convinced that Alice could not
know what she was saying, yet he involuntarily
cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Alice! I don&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pouted her lips, lips which to his excited
fancy seemed to have grown redder and
fuller than he had ever seen them, and she
made a droll little grimace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Alice, I tell you. Kiss me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In all their long engagement Alice had
never asked him for a caress, and the request
hurt him now as something unwomanly. Instead
of complying, he dropped his hands
and turned away. She laughed shrilly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t kiss me? I thought it
was polite to do what a lady asked! Well, if
you won&rsquo;t now, you will some time. You&rsquo;ll
want to when you know me better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She moved away, but he caught her by
the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he ordered her, with all the determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
he could put into the word. &ldquo;Wake
up, Alice! Be done with this fooling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bright face grew anxious and the pouting
lips beseeching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send me away! I&rsquo;ll be good!
Don&rsquo;t make her come back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; he repeated, clasping her arm
firmly, &ldquo;wake up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hurt me!&rdquo; she cried half whiningly.
&ldquo;You hurt me! I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wild brightness faded from the eyes,
a change too subtle to be defined seemed to
come over the whole figure, the old tired
expression spread like mist over the face,
and the familiar Alice stood there, passing
her hand over her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she asked, in a
startled way. &ldquo;Did I faint?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was conscious that his look must have
alarmed her, and he made a desperate effort
to speak easily and naturally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you came mighty near it,&rdquo; he
answered, as naturally as he could. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>For some days nothing unusual happened,
so far as Carroll knew. He watched Alice
closely, and he plunged into all the literature
on the subject of hypnotism upon which he
could lay hands. He was not sure that at the
end of a week&rsquo;s hard reading he was much
clearer than at the beginning, although he
had at least accumulated a fine assortment
of terms in the nomenclature of animal magnetism.
He cautiously questioned Abby,
and learned that for some time Alice had
been subject to what the old servant called
&ldquo;notional spells when she were n&rsquo;t herself.&rdquo;
His friend the specialist was greatly interested
in all that Dr. Carroll could tell him
about the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is evidently a subliminal self coming
to the surface,&rdquo; he pronounced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen
cases somewhat similar, but only one where
the patient was not hypnotized by somebody
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what can I do about it?&rdquo; George
demanded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any subliminal
selves floating about. I want the girl I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Build up her general health,&rdquo; the other
advised. &ldquo;You say she&rsquo;s run down and used
up with taking care of her grandmother.
Get her rested. That&rsquo;s the only thing I can
say. She is n&rsquo;t really ill, is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows what you call it,&rdquo; was Carroll&rsquo;s
response. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be called well
when she goes off the way she did the other
day. I tell you it was frightful, simply frightful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The days went on, and once more George
had the uncanny experience of a chat with
Jenny. Alice had been looking over some
of her grandmother&rsquo;s belongings, and when
he called, came down to him with a necklace
of rhinestones dangling and sliding through
her fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; she accosted him, in the buoyant
manner he remembered only too vividly,
&ldquo;is n&rsquo;t this gay? I should wear it, only I&rsquo;m
in her clothes, and she won&rsquo;t wear anything
but poky black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carroll tried to steady his nerves against
the sudden shock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you wear black, Alice,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;it is only six months since your
grandmother died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made him a merry, mocking grimace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t pretend you don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m
Jenny,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I saw you knew me the
minute you heard me speak. Alice! Pooh!
She&rsquo;d have come into the room this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She darted to the door and turned back,
to advance with her face pulled down and
her eyelids dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, dear?&rdquo; she greeted him,
with a burlesque of Alice&rsquo;s manner so droll
that he laughed in spite of himself.</p>

<p>Jenny herself burst into a shout of merriment
and whirled about in a pirouette,
swinging the sparkling chain around her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is n&rsquo;t it fun?&rdquo; she exclaimed, pausing
before him with her head on one side; &ldquo;she
can&rsquo;t even look at a bright thing half a minute
but off she goes, and here I am. Before
I go this time, I&rsquo;m going to stick up every
shiny thing I can find where she&rsquo;ll see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carroll had a sickening sensation, as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
girl he loved had gone mad before his very
eyes; yet so completely did she appear like
a stranger that the feeling faded as soon as
it arose. This was certainly no Alice that
he knew. He could not speak to her as his
friend and betrothed, although it was equally
impossible to address her as a stranger. He
was too completely baffled and confused to
be able to determine on any line of action,
and she stood smiling at him as if she were
entirely conscious of what was passing in his
troubled brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know I cut up her letter?&rdquo;
Jenny demanded, with a smile apparently
called up by the remembrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, exactly as if the
question had been put by a third person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was an awfully foolish letter,&rdquo; the girl
went on. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have her writing like that
to you. You&rsquo;ve got to belong to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had neither the time nor the coolness
to realize his emotions, but he accepted for
the moment the assumption of the individuality
of Jenny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are nothing to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am
engaged to Alice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right. I know that. I know
all about her; lots more than you do. But I tell
you, you&rsquo;d a great deal better take me. I&rsquo;m just
as much the girl you&rsquo;re engaged to as she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her darkly and with trouble
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Alice?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all right. She&rsquo;s somewhere.
Asleep, I think likely. I don&rsquo;t want to talk
about her. I never liked her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk about yourself, then. Where are
you when Alice is here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s stupid. I&rsquo;d rather talk about
what we&rsquo;ll do when we are married. Shall
we go abroad right off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be time enough to talk about that
when there&rsquo;s any prospect of our being married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would n&rsquo;t kiss me the other day,&rdquo;
Jenny said, looping the necklace about his
throat and bending forward so that her face
was close to his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>A feeling of anger so strong that it was
almost brutal came over him. He tore the
necklace out of her hands and threw it across
the room. Then, as on the previous occasion,
he caught the girl by the wrists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Let Alice
come back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you hurt me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
bear to be hurt! Let me go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tightened his grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go, I&rsquo;ll really hurt. I won&rsquo;t
have you fooling with Alice like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her glance wavered on his; then the eyelids
drooped; and he loosened his hold with
the consciousness that Alice had come back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, George,&rdquo; she said, in her natural
voice; &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t know you were here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took her in his arms with a feeling as
near to the hysterical as he was capable of,
and then instantly devoted himself to dissipating
the anxiety which his obvious agitation
aroused in her.</p>

<p>As time went on, the appearances of Jenny
became more frequent. The fact that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
secondary personality had once been in control
of the body which it shared with Alice
seemed to make its reappearance more easy.
Alice evidently became more susceptible to
whatever conditions produced this strange
possession. It was clear to Carroll that each
time the elfish Jenny succeeded in gaining
possession of consciousness,&mdash;for so he put
it to himself, entirely realizing what a confusing
paradox the phrase implied,&mdash;she
became stronger and better able to assert
herself. He grew more and more disturbed,
but he was also more and more completely
baffled. Sometimes the matter presented
itself to his professional mind as a medical
case of absorbing interest; sometimes it appealed
to him as a freak of gigantic irony
on the part of fate; and yet again he was
swept away by love or by passionate pity
and sorrow for Alice. He felt that, all unconscious
of her peril,&mdash;for she knew nothing
of her mysterious double,&mdash;she was being
robbed of her very personality.</p>

<p>Most curious of all was his feeling toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Jenny, who had come in his mind to represent
an individual as tangible, as human,
and as self-existent as Alice herself. He never
allowed himself to encourage her presence,
despite the fact that natural curiosity and
professional interest might well make him
eager to study her peculiarities. He insisted
always upon her speedy departure from the
body into which she had intruded herself&mdash;or
so he doggedly insisted with himself&mdash;like
an evil spirit. He had soon learned that
her fear of physical pain was excessive; that,
like the child that she often seemed, she could
be managed best by dread of punishment;
and he for a considerable time had been able
to frighten her away by threats of hurting
her. As the days went on, however, she began
to laugh at his menaces, and he was obliged
to resort to trifling physical force. The strong
grasp on the wrists had sufficed at first, but
it had to be increased as Jenny apparently
decided that he would not dare to carry out
his threats, and one day he found himself
twisting the girl&rsquo;s arm backward in a determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
effort to drive off this persistent ghoul-like
presence. The idea of injuring Alice
came over him so sickeningly that, had not
his betrothed at that instant recovered her
normal state, he felt that he must have abandoned
the field. As it was, he was so unmanned
that he could only plead a suddenly
remembered professional engagement and
get out of the house with the utmost possible
speed.</p>

<p>There were other moods which were perhaps
even worse. Now and again he was
conscious of a strong attraction toward this
laughing girl who defied him, looking at him
with the eyes of Alice, but brimming them
with merriment; who tempted him with
Alice&rsquo;s lips, yet ripened them with warm
blood and pouted them so bewitchingly;
who walked toward him with the form of his
betrothed, but swayed that body with a grace
and an allurement of which Alice knew nothing.
He felt in his nostrils a quiver of desire,
and shame and self-scorn came in its wake.
Not only did he feel that he had been false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to Alice, but by a painful and disconcerting
paradox he felt that he was offering to her
a degrading insult in being moved by what
at least was her body, as he might have been
moved by the sensual attractiveness of a light
woman. Jenny was at once so distinct, so
far removed from Alice, and yet so identified
with her, that his emotions confounded
themselves in baffling confusion. It was not
only that he could not think logically about
the matter, but he seemed also to have lost
the directing influence of instinctive feeling.
Jenny represented nothing ethical, nothing
spiritual, not even anything moral. He was
filled with disgust at himself for being moved
by her, yet humanly his masculine nature
could not but respond to her spell; and the
impossibility of either separating this from
his love for Alice or reconciling it with the
respect he had for her left him in a state
of mental confusion as painful as it seemed
hopeless.</p>

<p>He became so troubled that it was inevitable
Alice should notice his uneasiness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
he was not in the least surprised when one
evening she said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George, what is the matter? Are you
worrying about me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had prepared himself over and over
to answer such a question, but now he only
hesitated and stumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what makes you think anything
is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know there is; and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s my
fainting-spells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had come to speak of her seizures by
this term, and George had accepted it, secretly
glad that she had no idea worse than
that of loss of consciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I am troubled, so long as
you are not well, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like to tell me what is the matter,&rdquo;
she went on calmly, but with an earnestness
which showed she had thought long on
the matter. &ldquo;I dare say I should n&rsquo;t be any
better for knowing, and I can trust you; but I
know you are worrying, and it troubles me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His resolution was taken at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Alice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the truth is
that you need to get away from Boston and
have an entire change of scene and climate.
You used to be a good sailor, and a sea voyage
will set you up. I&rsquo;m going to marry you
next week and take you to Italy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, George, you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if I were well, I could n&rsquo;t be ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who cares? As to being well, you are
going so you may get well. When I order
patients to go away for their health, I expect
them to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She became serious, and looked at him
with eyes of infinite sadness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear George,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t marry
you just to be a patient. You must n&rsquo;t go
through life encumbered by an invalid wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no notion of doing anything of the
kind,&rdquo; he responded brightly. &ldquo;It would be
too poor an advertisement, and that&rsquo;s the
reason I insist on taking you abroad. What
day do you choose, Wednesday, Thursday,
or Friday? We sail Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>He would listen to no objections, but got
Thursday fixed for the wedding, and pushed
forward rapidly his preparations for going
abroad. He enlisted the coöperation of a
cousin of Alice, an efficient lady accustomed
to carry everything before her, and, as Abby
warmly approved of his decision, he felt that
Alice would be ready. He saw Alice but
briefly until Sunday evening, when he found
her in a state of much agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am really out of my mind,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;What do you think I have done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, if you have n&rsquo;t changed your
mind about Thursday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to change my mind. Oh, George,
I&rsquo;ve no right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is settled,&rdquo; he interrupted decisively.
&ldquo;What have you done that is so dreadful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She produced a waist of dove-colored silk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I could n&rsquo;t be married in black,
you know, and this was to be my dress. See
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The front of the waist was cut and slashed
from top to bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have done it some time to-day.
Oh, George, it&rsquo;s dreadful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time in all the long, hard trial
of their protracted engagement, she broke
down and cried bitterly. He took her in his
arms and soothed her. He told her he knew
all about it, and that she was going to be
entirely well; that he asked only that she
would not worry, but would trust to him that
she would come safely and happily out of all
this trouble and mystery. She yielded to his
persuasions, and, indeed, it was evident that
she had hardly strength to resist him even
had she not believed. She rested quietly on
his shoulder and let him drift into a description
of the route he had laid out, and in her
interest she seemed to forget her trouble.</p>

<p>Before he left, she asked him what she
could tell the dressmaker, who would suspect
if she was given no reason for being
called upon to make a new waist. He took
the injured garment, went to the writing-table,
and splashed ink on the cut portions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You showed it to me,&rdquo; he said gayly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
&ldquo;and I was so incredibly clumsy as to spill
ink on it. Men are so stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed, and he went away feeling
that he could gladly have throttled Jenny,
could he but succeed in getting her in some
other body than that belonging to his betrothed.
If he was irritated by this experience,
however, he had one to meet later which
tried him still more. Abby, on letting him
into the house on Tuesday, once more led
him mysteriously into the reception-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Alice&rsquo;s been writing to herself, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held toward him a sealed and stamped
envelope addressed to Alice. He took it half
mechanically, and as he wondered how he
was to circumvent this new trick of the maliciously
ingenious Jenny, he noted that the
handwriting was strangely different from
Alice&rsquo;s usual style.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she give you this to post?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was with the other letters, and I
noticed it and did n&rsquo;t mail it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You did perfectly
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>He wondered whether the prescience of
Jenny would enable her to discover that he
had destroyed her note to Alice; then he
smiled to realize how he was coming to think
of her as almost a supernatural demon, and
reflected that nothing could be easier than
for her to leave a paper where Alice must
find it. A couple of days later he found his
thought verified when Alice said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;George, who is Jenny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, she put into his hand an
unsigned note which said only, &ldquo;George loves
Jenny.&rdquo; The instant which was necessarily
taken for its examination gave him a chance
to steady himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrote it yourself,&rdquo; he said quietly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you recognize your paper and your
writing? It&rsquo;s a little strange, but sleep-writing
always is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am a somnambulist!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
with flushing cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing dreadful in that,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;You have promised to trust me
about your health. I know all about it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
if you write yourself forty notes, you are not
to bother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sighed, and then bravely smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to worry,&rdquo; she told him; &ldquo;but
I am a coward not to send you away. I
wonder why I should have chosen Jenny as
the name of your beloved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s an ugly name
enough,&rdquo; he responded, with a quick thought
that he hoped Jenny could hear. &ldquo;At any
rate, I tell you with my whole heart that you
are the only woman in the world for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not see Jenny again until the evening
before his marriage. He fancied she was
avoiding him, especially as once Alice sent
down word that she was too busy to see him.
He received, however, a note on Wednesday.
The hand, so like that of Alice and yet so
unmistakably different, affected him most
unpleasantly, nor was he made more at ease
by the contents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you got ahead of me by telling
Alice she was a sleep-walker, did n&rsquo;t you!
Well, I don&rsquo;t care, for I&rsquo;m going to get rid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
her for always when we are married. I did n&rsquo;t
mean to be married in that nasty old gray
dress, and I won&rsquo;t be, either. You see if I
am. You are very unkind to me. You might
remember that I&rsquo;m a great deal fonder of you
than she is, because I&rsquo;ve got real feeling and
she&rsquo;s a kind of graven image. You&rsquo;ll love
your little wifie Jenny very dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Carroll began to feel as if his own
brain were whirling. He could not reply to
the note, since he could hardly address a
letter to Jenny somewhere inside the personality
of Alice. He realized that a strain
such as this would soon so tell on him that
he would be unfit to care for Alice, and he
made up his mind that the time had come
for the strongest measures. To tell what the
strongest measures were, however, was a
problem which occupied him for the rest of
the day, and about which he consulted the
specialist. Even when, that evening, he
walked down West Cedar Street, he could
hardly be sure that he would carry out his
plan. He was told at the door by Abby that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Miss Alice had given strict orders against his
being admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did she do that?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This forenoon, sir, when she gave me that
note to send to you. She was queer, sir. She
had a cab and went down town shopping,
and came back with a big box. Then she
had a nap, and to-night she&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up, Abby. It is necessary for me
to see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he came into the drawing-room Alice
sprang up to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I began to be afraid you would n&rsquo;t come,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been queer to-day, I know;
and there&rsquo;s a dressmaker&rsquo;s box in my room I
never saw, and it&rsquo;s marked not to be opened
till to-morrow. Oh, George, I am so frightened
and miserable! I know I ought to send you
away, and not let you marry me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send me away, by all means, if it will
make you feel any better. I shan&rsquo;t go. Sit
down in this chair; I want to show you something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took the seat he indicated. He trimmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the fire and left the poker in the coals. Then
from his pocket he took a ball of silvered
glass as large as an orange, and began to toss
it in his hands. She stared at it in silence for
half a minute. Then the unmistakable laugh
of Jenny rang out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you really wanted to see me, did you?&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;I knew you would some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;You may be sure
I wanted to see you pretty badly before I&rsquo;d
take the risk of doing something that may
be bad for Alice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s still Alice, is it?&rdquo; Jenny responded,
pouting. &ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d got more
sense by this time. Honest, now,&rdquo; she continued,
leaning forward persuasively, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you think you&rsquo;d like me best? The trouble
is, you think you&rsquo;re tied to her, and you don&rsquo;t
dare do what you want to. I&rsquo;d hate to be
such a coward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at the beautiful creature bending
toward him, and he could not but acknowledge
in his heart that she was physically
more attractive than Alice, that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
stirred in him a fever of the blood which he
had never known when with the other. All
the attraction which had drawn him to Alice
was there, save for certain spiritual qualities,
and added was a new charm which he felt
keenly. He could not define to himself clearly,
moreover, what right or ground he had for
objecting to this form of the personality of
his betrothed, to this potential Alice, who in
certain ways moved him more than the Alice
he had known so long. He had only a dogged
instinct to guide him, an unescapable inner
conviction that the normal consciousness of
the girl had inalienable rights which manhood
and honor called upon him to defend.
In part this was the feeling natural to a physician,
but more it was the Puritan loyalty
to an idea of justice. The more he felt himself
stirred by the fascination of Jenny, the
more strongly his sense of right urged him
to end, if possible, this frightful possession
forever. Both for himself and for Alice, he
was resolute now to go to any extreme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are at liberty to put it any way you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
please,&rdquo; he responded to her taunt, with
grave courtesy. &ldquo;I called you to tell you that
I am going to marry Alice to-morrow, and
that I will not have her personality interfered
with any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t? How are you going to
help it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her eyes sparkling with mischievous
defiance, at her red lips pouted in
saucy insolence, and he wavered. Then in
the instant revulsion from this weakness he
turned to the fire and took from the coals
the glowing poker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is how I mean to help it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She shrank and turned pale; but she did
not yield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fool me like that,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You would n&rsquo;t really hurt the body of that
precious Alice of yours. You can&rsquo;t burn me
without her being burned too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had better be burned than to be
under the control of a little devil like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the moment they faced each other,
and then her glance dropped. She fell on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
her knees with a bitter cry, and held up to
him her clasped hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, why can&rsquo;t you let me stay!&rdquo; she half
sobbed. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you give me a chance?
You don&rsquo;t know how good I&rsquo;ll be! I&rsquo;ll do
every single thing you want me to. I know
all your ways as well as she does, and I&rsquo;ll
make you happy. Why should n&rsquo;t I have as
much right to live as she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wail of her pleading almost unmanned
him. He felt instinctively that his only chance
of carrying through his plan was to refuse to
listen. The thought surged into his mind
that perhaps she had as much claim to consciousness
as Alice; he seemed to be murdering
this strange creature kneeling to him
with streaming eyes and quivering mouth.
He had to turn away so as not to see her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not listen to you,&rdquo; he said doggedly.
&ldquo;I will not have you trouble Alice. As sure
as there&rsquo;s a God in heaven, if you come back
again when I am with her, I&rsquo;ll burn you with
a hot iron; and I mean to watch her all the
time after we are married.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you married me, you&rsquo;d have to help
me against her,&rdquo; Jenny said, apparently as
much to herself as to him.</p>

<p>He made no other answer than to bring
the heated iron so near to her cheek that she
must have felt its glow. She threw back her
head with a cry of fear. Then a look of
defiance came over the face, and the red
lips took a mocking curve; but in the twinkle
of an eye it was Alice who knelt on the rug
before him.</p>

<p>The strain of this interview, with the after-necessity
of reassuring Alice, left Carroll in
a condition little conducive to sleep. All night
he revolved in his head the circumstances
of this strange case, comforting himself as
well as he was able with the hope that at last
he had frightened Jenny away for good. He
reflected on the Scriptural stories of demoniacal
possession, and wondered whether hypnotism
might not have played some part in
them; he speculated on the future, and now
and then found himself wondering what
would have come of his choosing Jenny instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of Alice. A haggard bridegroom he
looked when Abby opened the door to him
the next forenoon, and he grew yet paler
when the old servant said to him, with brief
pathos,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She &rsquo;s queer again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carroll set his teeth savagely. He hardly
returned the greetings of the few friends assembled
in the drawing-room, but went at
once to the fireplace, applied a match to the
fire laid there, and thrust the poker between
the bars of the grate. The clergyman came
in, and in another moment the rustle of the
bride&rsquo;s gown was heard from the stairs outside.
Then, on the arm of a cousin of the
Gaylords, appeared in the doorway a figure
in white. The sweat started on Carroll&rsquo;s
forehead. He realized that Jenny was making
one more desperate effort to marry him. He
remembered her last words of the evening
before, and saw that then she must have had
this in mind. He looked her straight in the
eyes, and then turned to the grate. As he
stooped to grasp the poker the bride stopped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
trembled, put her hand to the door-jamb as
if for support. Then George, watching, put
the iron down and advanced to Alice. What
the assembled company might think of his
stirring the fire at that moment he did not
care. He felt that he had triumphed; and
at least it was Alice and not Jenny whom
he married.</p>

<p>So far as Carroll can determine, Jenny
never again intruded upon Alice&rsquo;s personality.
Renewed health, varied interests, and
the ever watchful affection of her husband
gave Mrs. Carroll self-poise and fixed her in
a normal state. But there is a little daughter,
and now and then the father catches his
breath, so startlingly into her face and into
her manner comes a likeness to Jenny.</p>

<h2>DR. POLNITZSKI</h2>


<p>&ldquo;So you think,&rdquo; Dr. Polnitzski said, smiling
rather satirically, &ldquo;that you are really tasting
the bitterness of life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t say anything of the sort,&rdquo; I retorted
impatiently. &ldquo;I was n&rsquo;t making anything
so serious of it; but you&rsquo;ll own that to
be thrown over your horse&rsquo;s head on a stake
that rips a gash six inches long in your thigh
is n&rsquo;t precisely amusing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite the contrary,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m prepared to admit so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the very middle of the hunting season,
too,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;and at the house of a friend.
More than that, a man never gets over the
feeling that everybody secretly thinks an
accident must be his own fault and he a
duffer. Even Lord Eldon, who&rsquo;s good nature
itself and no end of a jolly host, must
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; my physician interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
brusquely, &ldquo;Lord Eldon is not a fool, and
he realizes that this was n&rsquo;t your fault as
well as you do yourself. You take the whole
thing so hard because you&rsquo;ve evidently never
come in contact with the realities of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was so magnificent a man as he stood
there that the brusqueness of his words was
easily forgiven; he had been so unremitting
in his care ever since, in the illness of Lord
Eldon&rsquo;s family physician, he had been called
in on the occasion of my accident, that I
had become genuinely attached to him. Our
acquaintance had ripened into something
almost like intimacy, since my host and his
family had been unexpectedly called from
home by the illness of a married daughter,
and it had come to be the usual thing for Dr.
Polnitzski to pass with me the evenings of
my slow convalescence, which would otherwise
have been so intolerably tedious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say I&rsquo;ve been too much babied
most of my life,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;but a month
of this sort of thing is pretty serious for anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled, then his face grew grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you may think me tediously
moral,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help thinking
of what I see every day. For some years I&rsquo;ve
been trying to do something for the poor
people about here, and especially for the
operatives over at Friezeton. If you had any
idea of the things I&rsquo;ve seen&mdash; But, after all,
you would n&rsquo;t understand if I were to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;that you have
devoted yourself to the most generous work
among those poor wretches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; responded he, stiffening
at once, &ldquo;but we will, if you please, waive
compliments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I persisted, &ldquo;Lord Eldon and
others have more than once expressed their
wonder that you, with talents and acquirements
so unusual, should bury yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not speaking of myself,&rdquo; he interrupted,
somewhat impatiently, &ldquo;but of my
poor patients. If you knew what they suffer
uncomplainingly, it might make you a little
more content.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>We were both silent for a little time. I
looked across the chamber at the strong
figure of the Russian, as he stood by the fire,
and wondered what his past had been. I
knew that he was a mystery to all the neighborhood
where he had lived for the better
part of a dozen years. He was evidently a
gentleman, and he seemed to be wealthy. I
had myself found him to be of unusual culture
and refinement, and he had unobtrusively
won recognition as a physician of marked
skill and attainments. The wonder was why
he should be living in England as an exile,
and why he so persistently resisted all efforts
to draw him from his retirement. He devoted
himself to philanthropic work in a perfectly
quiet fashion, declining to be enrolled
as part of any organized charity. He was
more and more, however, coming to be appreciated
as a skillful physician, and to be called
in for consultation. He impressed me on
the whole as a man who had a past, and I
could not but wonder what that past had
been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right,&rdquo; I answered,
somewhat absently, &ldquo;but has it never occurred
to you that it is easy to make the mistake
of judging the suffering of others by
our own standards instead of by their real
feelings? It seems to be assumed nowadays
that all men are born with the same sensibilities,
yet nothing could be farther from
the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Polnitzski did not reply for a moment.
He seemed this evening to be unusually restless.
He walked about the room, getting up
as soon as he sat down, and made impulsive
movements which apparently betrayed some
inward disturbance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you are right,&rdquo; he said at
length, in an absent manner. &ldquo;The classes
not bred to sensitiveness cannot have the
real sensibility&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly and came across to
my couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were talking,&rdquo; he began, with a sudden,
bitter vehemence which startled me,
&ldquo;of real suffering. See! I have lived here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
silent in an alien land for long years; but
to-day&mdash;to-day is an anniversary, and I
have somehow lost the power to be silent
any longer. If you care to listen, I will tell
you what I mean by suffering; I will tell you
what life has been to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will,&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;I will try to
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed hardly to hear or to heed my
words, but, walking up and down the chamber,
he began at once, speaking with the
outbursting eagerness of a man who has restrained
himself long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was one of the
small nobles in the neighborhood of Moscow.
I was his only son, and when he died, in my
seventeenth year, I had been his companion
so much that I was as mature as most lads
half a dozen years older. My mother was
a gentle, good woman. I loved my mother,
but she made little difference in my life. She
was kind to me and she prayed for me a good
deal. She thought her prayers answered
when I grew up without debauchery. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
may have been right; but I have lived to
think that there are worse things than debauchery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and then went on,
looking downward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once the little mother was frightened,&rdquo;
he went on again, with a strange mingling
of bitterness and tenderness in his tone.
&ldquo;There was a girl, the daughter of the steward;
her name was Alexandrina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice as he pronounced the stately
name was full of feeling. He seemed to have
forgotten me, and to be telling his story to
an unseen hearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shurochka!&rdquo; he said, dwelling on the
diminutive with a fond, lingering cadence
most pathetic to hear. &ldquo;Shurochka! I loved
her; I was mad for her; my blood was full
of longing by day and of fire by night. It
was the complete, mad passion of a boy
grown into a man, and pure in spite of an
ardent temperament. I used to stand under
her window at night, and if it were stinging
with cold or storm I was glad. I seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
doing something for her; you know the madness,
perhaps, in spite of the cold temperament
of your race. I did not for a moment
really hope for her. Her family had betrothed
her to her cousin, and it would have broken
my mother&rsquo;s heart for me to marry the descendant
of serfs. I could n&rsquo;t even show her
that I loved her. My father out of his grave
said to me what he had said again and again
while he was alive: &lsquo;Do not hurt those under
you; and especially do not soil the purity of
a maiden.&rsquo; I did not try to conceal from the
little mother that I loved Shurochka, and
maybe the servants gossiped, as they always
do; but Shurochka herself I avoided. I was
not sure that I could trust myself to see her.
It was a happiness to the little mother when
the girl was married and taken away to the
home of her cousin in Moscow. She felt safe
for me then, and she was very tender. Time,
she said, would take this madness out of my
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked into the glowing fire with a
strange expression and mused a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My good mother!&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;She
was too near a saint to understand. That
has been a madness time could n&rsquo;t take out
of my heart! I&rsquo;ve gone out here on the moors
and flung myself down on the ground and
bitten the turf in agony because it seemed
to me that I had borne this as long as human
endurance was possible! No; if the spirit of
the little mother sees me, she knows that
time has not taken the madness out of me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face had grown white with feeling, and
he seemed to struggle to control himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you whether it was wholly
from the loss of her and the death of my
mother which came soon after, or whether
it was the current of the time, the unrest in
the air, that drew me toward the men who
were striving to free Russia from political
slavery. I went to St. Petersburg to continue
my studies, and there I was thrown
with men aflame with the ardor of patriotism.
Constantly the cause of Holy Russia secretly
took more and more absolute possession of
me. I confided it to nobody. I did not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
suspect that anybody had the smallest hint
of my state of mind, and yet, when the time
came, when I had made my decision to throw
in my lot with the patriots, I found them not
only ready, but expecting me. They had felt
my secret comradeship by that sixth sense
which we develop in Russia in our zeal for
country, and the imperative need of such an
intelligence in the work we have to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t take the step from simple
patriotism, perhaps. Motives are generally
mixed in this world. There was a last touch,
a final reason in my case, as in others, that
had a good deal of the personal. I was ripe
for the cause, but there was a gust to shake
the fruit down. There came bitter news from
Moscow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he paused, but only for a second;
then threw back his head and went on with
a new hardness in his tone more moving than
open fierceness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shurochka was gone. It was whispered
that a noble high in the army had carried
her off, but no one dared to speak openly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
We must be careful how we complain in
Holy Russia! When her husband tried to
find her, when he tormented the police to
right him, he was arrested as a political
offender&mdash;the charge always serves. The
man, as I afterward learned authoritatively,
was no more a conspirator than you are. He
was sent to the mines of Siberia simply because
he complained that his wife had been
stolen, and so made himself obnoxious to a
man in power. It was fortunate for me that
I did not learn the officer&rsquo;s name, or I should
have gone to Siberia too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Polnitzski threw himself into a chair
by the fire and remained staring into the
coals as if he had forgotten me, and as if he
again were back in the dreadful days of which
he had spoken. I waited some time before I
spoke, and then, without daring to offer sympathy,
I asked if he were willing to go on with
his story. He looked at me as if he saw me
through a dream; then he came to sit down
beside my couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was a fool to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
allow myself to speak, but now you may have
the whole of it. It is n&rsquo;t worth while for me
to tell you my experiences as a patriot&mdash;a
Nihilist, you would say. I was full of zeal;
I was young and hot-headed; I thought that
all the strength of my feeling was turned to
my country. I know now that a good deal of
it was consumed in the desire for revenge
upon that unknown officer. Russia, our Holy
Russia, I said to myself, must be to me both
wife and child. Stepniak said to me once that
Russia was the only country in the world
where it was a man&rsquo;s duty not to obey the
laws. You cannot understand it here in England,
where it never occurs to you to fear, as
you lie down at night, that for no fault whatever
you may in the morning find yourself
on the way to lifelong exile and some horrible,
living death. I could tell you things that I
can hardly think of without going mad; they
are the events of every day in our unhappy
land. The heroism, the devotion, of those
striving to free Russia can be believed only
by the few that know they are true. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
are beyond human; they are divine. Why,
the things I have known done by women
so pure and delicate that they were almost
angels already&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He broke off and wiped his forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said he, in a tone he
evidently tried to make more natural. &ldquo;I
will not talk of this. I have not spoken so
for years and I cannot command myself. It
is enough for you to know that I saw it all,
and that, to the best of my ability, I did my
part. As time went on, I established myself
as a physician at St. Petersburg. My family
connection, although I had no near relatives,
was of use to me, and in the end I had an excellent
position. I was fortunate in the curing
of wounds, and I had the luck to attract attention
by saving the life of a near relative
of the Czar. All this I looked at as so much
work done for the cause. Every advance I
made in influence, in wealth, in power, put
me in a position to be so much the more serviceable
to the great purpose of my life. Personal
ambition was so swallowed up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
tremendousness of that issue that self was
lost sight of. The patriot cannot remember
himself in a land like Russia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the execution&rdquo;&mdash; He paused and
turned to me with a singular smile. &ldquo;You
would say the assassination&mdash;when the
death of General Kakonzoff was determined
in our Section, no part was assigned to
me, but I was high enough in the counsels
of the patriots to know all that was done.
He had possession of information which it
was necessary to suppress. He came to St.
Petersburg to present it in person. He told
me frankly enough afterward that he could
not trust any one because he counted upon
a reward for giving the evidence himself.
We were minutely informed of his plans and
his movements. We had taken the precaution
to replace his body-servant by one of our own
men as soon as he began to make inquiries
about two patriots who were suspected
by the government. He had proofs which
would have been fatal to them, and it was
necessary to intercept these. If he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
put out of the way, our agent would easily
have got possession of the papers, and without
the testimony of the general our two
friends were safe. The plot failed through
one of those chances that make men believe
in the supernatural. He was shot as he
stepped out of the train at the St. Petersburg
station, but the very instant our man fired,
Kakonzoff stumbled. The bullet, which
should have gone through his heart, passed
through his lungs without killing him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The perfectly cool manner in which Dr.
Polnitzski spoke of this incident affected me
like a vertigo. To have a man who is one&rsquo;s
daily companion, and of whom one has become
fond, speak of an assassination as if it
were an ordinary occurrence, is almost like
seeing him concerned himself in a murder.
I lay there listening to the doctor with a fascination
not unmixed with horror, despite
the fact that my sympathies, as he knew
beforehand, were strongly with the Nihilists.
To be in sympathy with their cause and to
come so near as to smell the reek of blood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
so to speak, were, however, very different
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By a strange chance,&rdquo; the doctor went
on, &ldquo;I was summoned to attend the wounded
man, and although it was a desperate fight,
I was after some days satisfied that I could
save his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why
you should try to save his life if you were of
those who doomed him to death in the first
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me piercingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that I was
called to him as a physician. It is the duty
of a physician to save life, as it may be the
duty of a patriot to take it. I was trying to
do my best in both capacities. I had given
the best counsel I could in the Section and,
when he was on his feet, I would have shot
him myself if it had seemed to my superiors
that I was the best person to do it. Does it
seem to you that I could have taken advantage
of his helplessness, of his confidence, of
my skill as a physician, to deprive him of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
life which it is the aim of a physician&rsquo;s existence
to preserve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited for me to reply, but I had no
answer to give him. The situation was one
so far outside of my experience, so fantastically
unreal as measured by my own life, that
I could not even judge of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he went on, leaning forward with
shining eyes and with increasing excitement
of manner, &ldquo;the patient puts himself into
the hands of his physician, body and soul.
To betray that trust is to strike at the very
heart of the whole sacred art of healing. If
I, as a physician, took advantage of this sick
man, I not only betrayed the personal trust
he put in me, but I was false to the whole
principle on which the relation of doctor and
patient rests. Don&rsquo;t you see what a tremendous
question is involved? That to harm
Kakonzoff was to go beyond the limits of
human possibility?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was my answer; &ldquo;I can understand
how a doctor might feel that; but I
don&rsquo;t know how far the feeling of a patriot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
might overbalance this; how far the idea of
serving his country would overcome every
other feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polnitzski gave me a glance which made
me quiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a question which I found I did not
readily answer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I received
from the chief of our Section an order not
to let Kakonzoff recover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sprang up from his chair and began
to pace the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could I do?&rdquo; he said, pouring out
his words with a rapidity which increased
his slight foreign accent so that when his face
was turned away I could hardly follow them.
&ldquo;There was my country bleeding her very
heart&rsquo;s blood. Every day the most infamous
cruelties were done before my eyes. And if
this man Kakonzoff lived to tell his story, it
meant the torture, the death, of men whose
only crime was that they had given up everything
that makes life tolerable to save their
fellows from political slavery. It lay in my
power to let Kakonzoff die. A very slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
neglect would accomplish that. To the cause
of my country I had sworn the most solemn
oaths, and sworn them with my whole heart.
I had never before even questioned any
order from the Section. I had obeyed with
the blind fidelity of a man that loved the
cause too well to think of his own will at all.
But now&mdash;now, I simply found what I was
asked to do was impossible! I could not do it.
I fought it out with myself day and night, and
all the time the patient was slowly getting
better. The gain was slow, but it was steady,
and I could not fail to see that his giving his
wicked testimony against the patriots was
simply a matter of time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But one day, through no fault of mine&mdash;indeed,
because my express orders had been
disobeyed&mdash;he became worse. I can&rsquo;t tell
you the relief I felt in thinking the man might
die and I be spared the awful necessity of
deciding. If he would only die without fault
of mine&mdash;but I still did my best. I gave
minute directions, and when I left him I
promised to return in a few hours. As I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
through the antechamber on my way out of
the hotel, some one came behind me quickly
and laid a hand on my arm. I thought it was
the nurse, following to ask some question.
I turned round to be face to face with Shurochka!
My God! It was like a crazy farce
or a bad dream!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is impossible that Dr. Polnitzski should
not have known what an effect his story was
producing on me, and it is hardly doubtful
that his responsive Slav nature was more or
less moved by my excitement. He seemed,
however, scarcely to be conscious of me at
all. His face was white with suffering, and he
spoke with the vehemence of one who tries
to be rid of intolerable pain by pouring it out
in words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a flash,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;it came over
me what her presence meant, and I said to
myself, &lsquo;I will kill him!&rsquo; I had always hoped
that in striking against the creatures of the
Czar&rsquo;s tyranny I might unknowingly reach
the man that had harmed her; but I had
wished not to know, for I could not bear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
personal feeling should come into the work
I did for my country. That work was the
one sacred thing. Now what I had feared
had been thrust on me. Shurochka was
changed; there were marks of suffering in
her face, and she showed, too, the effects of
training which could never have come honestly
into the life of a woman of her station.
She was dressed like a lady. At first she did
not know me. She spoke to me as a stranger,
and implored me to save Kakonzoff. She
caught me by the arm in her excitement;
and then she recognized me. Then&mdash;oh,
my God, what creatures women are!&mdash;then
she cried out that I had loved her once, and
that in memory of that time I must help her.
Think of it! She flung my broken heart in
my face to induce me to save the scoundrel
she loved!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Alexandrina, my old-time Shurochka,
clinging to me as if she had risen
from the grave where her shame should have
been hidden, and I loved her then and always.
I could hardly control myself to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to her. All I could do was stupidly to ask if
he was kind to her, and she shrank as if I had
lashed her with the knout. She cried out that
it was no matter, so long as she loved him,
and that I must save him: that she could not
live without him. I&mdash;could n&rsquo;t endure it!
I shook off her hands and rushed away more
wild than sane, with her voice in my ears all
agony and despair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face was dreadful in its pain, and I
felt that I had no right to see it. I closed my
eyes, and tried to turn away a little, but in
my clumsiness I knocked from the couch a
book. The crash of its fall aroused him. He
mechanically picked up the volume, and the
act seemed somewhat to restore him to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may judge,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;the
hell that I was in. I could have torn the man
to bits, and yet&mdash;and yet now I said to myself
that to obey the Section and let Kakonzoff
die would be doing a murder to gratify
personal hate. Yet all the sides of the question
tortured me. I asked the valet in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
afternoon about the woman that had spoken
to me. He shrugged his shoulders, and said
she was only a peasant that the general was
tired of, but that she would not leave him,
although he beat her. He beat her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were tears in my eyes at the intensity
with which he spoke, but Dr. Polnitzski&rsquo;s
were dry. He clenched his strong hands as
if he were crushing something. Then he
shook himself as if he were awaking, and
threw back his head with a bitter attempt at
a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a shrug. &ldquo;I
have never talked like this in my life, but
it is so many years since I talked at all that
I have lost control of myself. I beg your
pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He crossed the room, sat down by the fire,
and began to fill his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Dr. Polnitzski,&rdquo; I protested eagerly,
&ldquo;I do not want to force your confidence, but
you cannot stop such a story there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me a moment as if he would
not go on. Then his face darkened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What could the end of such a story be?&rdquo;
he demanded. &ldquo;Any end must be ruin and
agony. Should I be moved by personal feelings
to be false to everything I held sacred?
Should I take my revenge at the price of professional
honor? I said to myself that in time
she might come to care for me, if this man
were out of her life. Kindness could do so
much with some women. But could I make
such a choice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said slowly, &ldquo;you could not do
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I restore him to life, then, and
have him go on beating that poor girl and
flinging her into the ditch at last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I let him live to destroy the patriots
whose sworn fellow I was? Do you think
I could ever sleep again without dreaming
of their fate? Could I kill him there in his
bed&mdash;I, the physician he trusted? Could I
do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;what did you
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>He regarded me with a look that challenged
my very deepest thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The patriots were spared,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;That was my fee for saving the life of
General Kakonzoff. A year later I paid for
having asked that favor by being exiled
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;the other?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She, thank God, is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment or two we remained motionless
and unspeaking. Then I silently held
out my hand to him. I had no words.</p>

<h2>IN THE VIRGINIA ROOM</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Childless,&rdquo; was the word which she murmured
in her heart, as she entered the building
which had once been the Presidential
Mansion of Jefferson Davis and now is the
Confederate Museum. Why the thought of
her estranged daughter flashed upon her as
she came to do honor to the memory of her
long dead husband, Mrs. Desborough could
not have told, but so overwhelming was the
sadness of her mood that she could hardly
wonder if this bitter memory took advantage
of her moment of weakness to obtrude itself.
She set her lips tightly and put it determinedly
into the background. She would
not think of the daughter who was lost to
her; to-day and here no thought but should
go back in loving homage and passionate
grief to the hero whose name she bore.</p>

<p>She went at once to the Virginia Room,
bowing quickly but kindly to the custodian of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the Museum, and as she pushed open the door
of the sad place, she thought herself alone.
The heavy April rain which was drenching
Richmond outside kept visitors away, and
the building was almost deserted. In her
yearly visits to this spot, those pilgrimages
which she had made as to a shrine, she had
once before had the Virginia Room to herself,
untroubled by the presence of strangers;
and now with a quick sigh of relief she realized
how great had been the comfort of that
solitude. To her sensitive nature it was hard
to stand before the memorials of her dead
and yet to be aware that strange eyes, eyes
curious if sympathetic, might be reading in
her face all the emotions of her very soul.
To preserve the calm necessary before the
public had always seemed to her almost like
being untrue to the memory she came to
consecrate; and to-day it was with a swelling
sigh of relief that she threw back her heavy
widow&rsquo;s veil with the free, proud motion
which belonged to the women of her race
and time&mdash;the women bred in the South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
before the war. She was an old woman,
though not much over sixty, for pain can age
more swiftly than time. The high-bred mien
would be hers as long as life remained,
and wonderful was her self-control. Again
and again she had felt unshed tears burn in
her eyes like living fire, yet had been sure
that no stranger had had reason to look
upon her as more than a casual visitor to the
museum; but to be able to let her grief have
way seemed almost a joy. She felt the quick
drops start at the bare thought. Life had left
her no greater blessing than this liberty to weep
undiscovered over the memorials of her dead.</p>

<p>At the instant a man came from behind
one of the cases, so near that she might have
touched him. Instinctively she tried to take
her handkerchief from her chatelaine, and
in her confusion detached the bag. It fell at
the feet of the gentleman, who stooped at
once to pick it up. As he held it out, she
forced a smile to her fine old face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&mdash;I was very
awkward.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;Those bags
are so easily unhooked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tone struck her almost like a blow.
To the disappointment of finding that she
was not alone in this solemn place was added
the bitter fact that the intruder who had come
upon her was not of her people. An impulse
of bitterness from the old times of blood and
of fire swept over her like a wave. The room
had carried her back as it always did to the
past, and after almost two-score years she
for the first time broke through the stern
resolve that had kept her from hostile speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a Northerner!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The words were nothing, but the tone, she
knew, was hot with all the long pent-up bitterness.
She felt her cheek flush as, almost before
the words were spoken, she realized what
she had said. The stranger, however, showed
no sign of resentment. He smiled, then grew
grave again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Do not Northerners visit the Museum?
I supposed nobody came to Richmond
without coming here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>She was painfully annoyed, and felt her
thin cheeks glow as hotly as if she were still
a girl. To be lacking in politeness was sufficiently
humiliating, but to seem rude to one
from the North, to fail in living up to her
traditions, was intolerable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she forced herself
to say. &ldquo;To come through that door is to
step into the past, and I spoke as I might
have when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a Yankee in the house of President
Davis would have required explicit explanation,&rdquo;
the stranger finished the sentence she
knew not how to complete.</p>

<p>Even in her discomposure she appreciated
both the courtesy which spared her the embarrassment
of being left in the confusion
of an unfinished remark and the adroitness
which gave to his reply just the right tone of
lightness. He was evidently a man of the
world. Her instinct, not to be outdone in
politeness, least of all by one of her race,
made her speak again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was rude,&rdquo; she said stiffly. &ldquo;To-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
is an anniversary on which I always come
here, and I forgot myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must have seemed doubly obtrusive,&rdquo;
he returned gravely.</p>

<p>He was certainly a gentleman. He was
well groomed, moreover, with the appearance
of quiet wealth. One of his hands was
ungloved, and she noted appreciatively how
finely shaped it was, how white and well
kept. The North had all the wealth now,
she reflected involuntarily, while so many
of the descendants of old Southern families
were forced to earn their very bread by occupations
unworthy of them. They could not
keep their fine hands, hands that told of
blood and breeding for generations, as could
this stranger before her. His attractiveness,
his air of prosperity, were offensive to her
because they emphasized the pitiful poverty of
so many of her kin whose forefathers had
never known what want could be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Museum is open to the public,&rdquo; she
replied, with increasing coldness.</p>

<p>She expected him to bow and leave her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Not only did he linger, but she seemed to
see in his face a look of pity. Before she could
resent this pity, however, she met his eyes
with her own, and the look seemed to her
to be one of sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you pardon my saying that I too came
here to-day because it is an anniversary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An anniversary?&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;How
can an anniversary bring a Northerner here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is n&rsquo;t mine exactly. It is my son&rsquo;s.
His mother is a Virginian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So highly strung was her mood that she
noticed almost with approval that he had
said &ldquo;is&rdquo; and not &ldquo;was.&rdquo; He had at least
not deprived his wife of her birthright as a
daughter of the sacred soil. She began to be
aware of a growing excitement. She could
hardly have heard unmoved any allusion to
a marriage which had taken from the South
a woman born to its traditions and to its
sorrows. She felt a fresh impulse of anger
against this prosperous son of the North
who had carried away from a Virginia mother
a daughter as she had been robbed of hers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
The cruel pang of crushed motherhood which
ached within her at the remembrance of her
own child, the child she had herself cast off
because of her marriage, was so fierce that
for a moment she could not command her
voice. She could not shape the question which
was in her heart, but she felt that with her
eyes she all but commanded the stranger to
tell her more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We live in the North,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;but she has long promised the boy that
when he was eight he should see the relics
of his Virginian grandfather which are in the
museum here. Unfortunately, when the time
came, she was not well enough to come with
him; and as she wished him to be here on
this especial day, I have brought him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Southern woman felt her heart beating
tumultuously, and it was almost as if
another spoke when she said in a manner
entirely conventional:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust that her illness is not serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it were, I should not be here myself,&rdquo;
he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>She collected her strength, which seemed
to be leaving her, and forced herself to look
around the room. She could not have told
what she expected, or whether she most
hoped or feared what she might see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your son?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s face changed subtly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;was an officer
in the Union army. I wished to see this place
first, to be prepared for Desborough&rsquo;s questions.
It is n&rsquo;t easy to answer the questions
of a clever lad whose two grandfathers have
been killed in the same battle, fighting on
opposite sides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name struck her like a blow. She
leaned for support against the corner of the
nearest case, and fixed her gaze on the pathetic
coat of General Lee behind the glass
which showed her as a faint wraith the reflection
of her own face. Desborough had been
her husband&rsquo;s name, and this the anniversary
of his death; she felt as if the dead had
arisen to confront her, and that some imperative
call in the blood insistently responded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Yet she could not believe that her son-in-law
was before her, regarding her with that
straightforward, appealingly honest gaze; she
said to herself that the name was merely a
coincidence, that every day in the year was
the anniversary of the death of some Virginian
hero, and that this could not be her
daughter&rsquo;s husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you decided what to tell your son?&rdquo;
she heard her voice, strange and far off, asking
amid the thrilling quiet of the room.</p>

<p>The stranger regarded her as if struck by
the note of challenge in her tone. His serious
eyes seemed to her to be endeavoring to probe
her own in search of the cause of her sharpness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do no more,&rdquo; was his answer, &ldquo;than
to tell him what I have always told him&mdash;the
truth, as far as I can see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the truth which you can tell him here&mdash;here,
before the sacred relics of our dead,
the sacred memorials of our Lost Cause&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not go on, but stopped suddenly
that he might not hear her voice break.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has never been taught anything but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
that the men of the South fought for what
they believed, and that no man can do a
nobler thing than to give his life for his faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She became suddenly and illogically sure
that she was talking to her son-in-law, although
the ground of her conviction was no
other than the one she had just before rejected.
The whole thing flashed upon her
mind as perfectly simple. Her daughter
knew that on this day she was always to be
found here, and had meant to meet her, with
the little son bearing his grandfather&rsquo;s name.
The question now was whether the husband
knew. Something in his air, something half-propitiatory,
something certainly beyond the
ordinary deference offered to a lady who is a
stranger, gave her a vague distrust. She was
not untouched by the desire for reconciliation,
but she had again and again resisted that
before, and least of all could she tolerate the
idea of being tricked. The possibility that
her son-in-law might be feigning ignorance
to work the more surely upon her sympathy
angered her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; she demanded
abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he answered, evidently
surprised, &ldquo;but I have never been in
Richmond before. If you are well known
here, or are the wife of some man famous in
the South, I am too completely a stranger to
recognize you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you seemed to wish to explain yourself
to me. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he began hesitatingly,
searching her face with his straightforward
gray eyes. Then he flushed slightly, and
broke out with new feeling: &ldquo;Yes; I do know.
You came just as I was going away because
I could not endure the sadness of it; when
every one of these cases seemed to me to drip
with blood and tears. That sounds to you
extravagant, but the whole thing came over
me so tremendously that I could n&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; she returned tremulously.
&ldquo;You have such collections at the
North, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But here it came over me that to all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
sorrow of loss was added the bitterness of
defeat. I felt that no Southerner could come
here without feeling that all the agony this
commemorates had been in vain; and the pity
of it took me by the throat so that when I
spoke to you, you were a sort of impersonation
of the South&mdash;of the Southern women;
and I wanted to ask for pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath and raised her
head proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for the war,&rdquo; he said quickly, with
a gesture which seemed to wave aside her
pride and showed her how well he had understood
her triumph at the admission seemingly
implied in his words. &ldquo;I am a Northern man,
and I believe with my whole soul that the
North was right. I believe in the cause for
which my father died. Only I see now that
if he had lived in the South, the same spirit
would have carried him into the Confederate
army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for what should you ask pardon, if
the North was in the right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For myself; for not understanding&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
being so dull all these years that I have
lived with a wife faithful in her heart to the
South and too loyal to me to speak. We in
the North have forgiven, and we think that
the South should forget. It has come over
me to-day how easy it is for the conquerors
to forgive and how hard that must be for the
conquered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand even now,&rdquo; she
said, her voice low with feeling. &ldquo;Because
we are conquered we can forgive; but we
should be less than human to forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room was very still for a little, and
then, following out her thought, she said as
if in wonder: &ldquo;And you, a Northerner, have
felt all this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head, with a little smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is perhaps too much to ask,&rdquo; returned
he, &ldquo;that you Southern women should realize
that even a Northerner is still human.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; but to feel our suffering, to
see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has always been facing me, I understand
now, in my wife&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;the immeasurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
pathos of a people beaten in a struggle
they felt to be right; but she had been so
happy otherwise, and she never spoke of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the heart of every Southern woman,&rdquo;
she said solemnly, though now without bitterness,
&ldquo;is always the anguish of our Lost
Cause. We cover the surface, we accept, and
God knows we have been patient; but each
of us has deep down a sense of the blood
that was poured out in vain, of the agony of
the men we loved, of how they were humiliated&mdash;humiliated,
and of the great cause of
liberty lost&mdash;lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For long, bitter years she had not spoken
even to her nearest friends as she was talking
to this stranger, this Northerner. The consciousness
of this brought her back to the
remembrance that he was the husband of
her daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has your wife no relatives in the South
who might have made you understand how
we Southern women must feel?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>He grew instantly colder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen her Southern relatives.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon the curiosity of an old woman,&rdquo;
she went on, watching him keenly; &ldquo;may I
ask why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s mother did not choose to know
the Yankee her daughter married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not choose to force an acquaintance
or to be known on sufferance,&rdquo; he answered
crisply. &ldquo;I was aware of no wrong, and I
did not choose to ask to be forgiven for being
a Northerner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew that in her heart she was already
accepting this strong, fine man, alien as he
was to all the traditions of her life, and she
was not ill pleased at his pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But have you ever considered what it
must have cost the mother to give up her
daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why need she have given her up? Marriages
between the North and the South have
been common enough without any family
breach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was utterly sure that he knew neither
to whom he was talking nor what had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the real cause of her separation from her
daughter. She experienced a sort of wild
inner exultation that at last had come the
moment when she might justify herself;
when she might tell the whole dreadful story
which had been as eating poison in her veins.
She raised her head proudly, and looked at
him with her whole soul in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have patience to listen,&rdquo; she said,
feeling her cheeks warm, &ldquo;and will pardon
my being personal, I should like to tell you
what has happened to me. My husband was
a colonel in the Confederate army. We were
married when I was seventeen, in a brief
furlough he won by being wounded at the
battle of the Wilderness. I saw him, in the
four years of the war before he fell at Five
Forks, less than a dozen times, and always
for the briefest visits&mdash;poor scraps of fearful
happiness torn out of long stretches of agony.
My daughter, my only child, was born after
her father&rsquo;s death. Our fortune had gone to
the Cause. My father and my husband both
refused to invest money abroad. They considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
it disloyal, and they put everything
into Confederate securities even after they
felt sure they should get nothing back. They
were too loyal to withhold anything when
the country was in deadly peril.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused, but he did not speak, and
with swelling breast and parching throat she
went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Five Forks my husband was killed
in a hand-to-hand fight with a Northern
officer. He struck his enemy down after he
had received his own death-wound. I pray
God he did not know the day was lost. He
had gone through so much, I hope that was
spared him. On the other side of death he
must have found some comfort to help him
bear it. God must have had some comfort
for our poor boys when he permitted the cause
of liberty to be lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pressed her clenched hand against her
bosom, and as she did so her eyes met those of
her companion. She felt the sympathy of his
look, but something recalled her to the sense
that she was speaking to one from the North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not the cause of liberty to you,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I have forgotten again. I have not
spoken of all this for so long. I have not
dared; but to-day&mdash;to-day I must speak,
and you must forgive me if I use the old
language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped his glance as if he felt it an
intrusion to see her bitter emotion, and said
softly: &ldquo;I think I understand. You need not
apologize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the war,&rdquo; she went on hurriedly
and abruptly, &ldquo;I lived for my daughter. I
worked for her. She&mdash;she was like her
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She choked, but regained the appearance
of composure by a mighty effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When she was a woman&mdash;she was still
a child to me; over twenty, but I was not
twice her age&mdash;she went North, and there
she fell in love. She wrote me that she was
to marry a Northerner, and when she added
his name&mdash;it was the son of the man who
killed her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not possible!&rdquo; the other exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
&ldquo;You imagined it. Such things happen in
melodramas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put up her hand and arrested his
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This happened not in a melodrama, but
in a tragedy&mdash;in my life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
need not go into details. She married him,
and I have never seen her since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It was my wedding gift to my
daughter&mdash;that I kept her secret. That
was all I had strength to do. You think I
was an unnatural mother, of course; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She saw that his eyes were moist as he
raised them in answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have said so yesterday without
any hesitation; to-day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day?&rdquo; she echoed eagerly, as he
paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; he answered, letting his glance
sweep over the pathetic memorials so thick
about them&mdash;&ldquo;to-day at least I understand,
and I do not wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with all her heart in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
her eyes, trying to read his most hidden feeling.
Then she touched his arm lightly with
the tips of her slender black-gloved fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She led him across the room, and pointed
to a colonel&rsquo;s sash and pistols which lay in
one of the cases under a faded card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those were my husband&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You Louise&rsquo;s mother?
It is impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be impossible; but, as I said of
the other thing, it is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other thing?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What&mdash;do
you mean the thing you said&mdash;that
my father and he&mdash; That cannot be true. I
should surely have known!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;At the moment
it happened they were surrounded by our
soldiers, and his own men probably did not
realize just what happened. But I&mdash;I know
every minute of that fight! One of my husband&rsquo;s
staff had been at West Point with
them both, and he told me. He saw it, and
tried to come between them. Your wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
married you, knowing you to be the son of
the man who killed her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Northerner passed his hand across
his forehead as if to wipe away the confusion
of his mind. His eyes were cast down, but
she saw that their lids were wet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Louise!&rdquo; he murmured, seemingly
rather to himself than to her; &ldquo;how she must
have suffered over that secret. Poor Louise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come here,&rdquo; Mrs. Desborough went
on, feeling herself choke at his words, but
determined not to give way to the warmer
impulse of her heart, &ldquo;and even you are
moved by these sacred relics. What do you
think they are to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was half conscious that she was appealing
to the memorials around her to
strengthen her in her purpose not to yield,
not to make peace with the son of the man
who had slain her husband, her hero, her
love; she felt that in harboring for an instant
such an impulse she was untrue to the Cause
which, though lost, was for her forever living
with the deathless devotion of love and anguish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;These relics do move me,&rdquo; her son-in-law
said gently. &ldquo;They move me so deeply
that they seem to me wrong. I confess that I
was thinking, before you came in, that if I
were a Southerner, with the traditions of the
South behind me, and the bitter sense of
failure to embitter me, they would stir me to
madness; that I should feel it impossible ever
to be loyal to anything but the South. The
war is over. The South at last is understood.
She is honored for the incredible bravery
with which, under crushing odds, she fought
for her conviction. Why prolong the inevitable
pain? Why gather these relics to nourish
a feeling absolutely untrue&mdash;the feeling
that the Union is less your country than it is
ours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is just to the dead,&rdquo; she answered
swiftly. &ldquo;Because it is only justice
that we keep in remembrance how true they
were, how gallant, how brave, how noble, and&mdash;O
God!&mdash;that we make some poor record
of what we of the South have suffered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head and sighed. She saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the tears in his eyes and did not attempt to
hide her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you have it forgotten,&rdquo; she demanded
passionately, &ldquo;that the grandfather
of your son&mdash;the father of your wife&mdash;was
one of God&rsquo;s noblemen? Would you have
him remembered only as a beaten rebel? I
tell you that if we had not gathered these
memorials, every clod that was wet with
their blood would cry out against us! In the
North you call these men rebels; there is no
battlefield in the South where the very rustle
of the grass does not whisper over their graves
that they were patriots and heroes! And
this, poor though it be&rdquo;&mdash;and she waved
her hand to the cases around them&mdash;&ldquo;is
the best memorial we can give them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a step forward, and held out both
his hands impulsively. She did not take
them, and they dropped again. He hesitated,
and then drew back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be as it is,&rdquo; he said sadly. &ldquo;Even
if I blamed you women of the South, I could
not say so here. Only,&rdquo; he added, his voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
falling, &ldquo;can you forget that the women of
the North suffered too? I grew up in the
shadow of a grief so great that it sapped the
very life of my mother, and in the end killed
her. Do you think I could visit that upon
the innocent head of Louise?&mdash;I did not
mean, though, to speak of myself, now that
I know who you are. I will not intrude on
you; but my little son, with your husband&rsquo;s
name and his mother&rsquo;s eyes, is certainly
guiltless. I will not come with him, but may
I not send him with my man to see you this
afternoon, so that I may say to Louise that
you have kissed him and given him your
blessing? Sorrow has taken away his other
grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she could not endure
the speaking of one syllable more. Her whole
body trembled, and she raised her hands in
an impulsive gesture which implored him to
be silent. All the old mother-love for Louise,
the passionate crying of her lonely heart for
this unseen grandson with the blood of her
dead husband warm in his veins, the grief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
of black years and fidelity to old ideals,
warred within her, and tore her like wolves.
She cast a glance around as if to find some
way by which she could flee from this position
which it was too terrible to face. Then she
saw her companion look at her with infinite
pity and sadness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can only say good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she sprang forward as if she burst
from chains, and threw herself upon his
breast, the agony of the long, bitter past
gushing in a torrent of hot tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my son! my son!&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
